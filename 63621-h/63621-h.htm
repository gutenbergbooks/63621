</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> articles in this book, with the exception of the
first two, were all written during the war at the request
of the various editors by whose courtesy they are now
reproduced in volume form. Most of them, notably
those which appeared in the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>, were,
by my own desire, gratuitous, though payment for
them was offered. But, being unable to handle sword
or gun, I was glad to offer the free service of my pen
whenever such service was desired, or considered
useful, just as I would have been glad, had I been a
man, to fight voluntarily for Great Britain, without
any thought of other recompense than that of the
personal pride and joy such action would have given
me. The first two articles: “Savage Glory” and “The
Great Unrest,” were published some considerable
time before the outbreak of war, and while the editor
of <i>Nash’s Magazine</i> was generous to a fault in his
praise of “Savage Glory” he was so doubtful as to the
accuracy of the indictment conveyed in “The Great
Unrest” that he felt himself compelled to preface it
by a note, stating that he, or rather “we,” could not
be held responsible for any agreement with or endorsement
of the author’s ideas. Readers can now judge
for themselves whether those ideas were fairly prophetic
or otherwise. Naturally, no heed was paid to
them, except by a huge silent public, the press apparently
making it a rule not to notice in any one paper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>viii</span>
what their rivals print in others, unless it happens
to be by one of their own special clique, or the utterance
of a Cabinet Minister, which they generally
misquote. But, such as they are, these various contributions
to English and American sections of journalism
indicate the straight and loyal road my pen has travelled
during the wickedest and stupidest war that ever
devastated the world. The stupidity of it was even
more glaring than the wickedness of it—especially
in the case of Germany. Germany was an advancing
and prosperous nation, chiefly through the industrial
progress of her hard-working people, and her “peaceful
penetration” was conquering every quarter of commerce.
She has, for the time being, ruined everything by a
blind faith in and following of her scoundrels of
finance, for whom the Krupp and other dividends were
not sufficiently high or secure; the work of years has
now been destroyed and every gain has to be discounted
as loss, though there is not the slightest doubt
that her cleverness and cunning will enable her to
mend the hole in her wall far more rapidly than our
dilly-dally statesmen imagine. For the immediate
time, her degradation and ruin involve more than her
own position; other nations, even our own, are deeply
affected, and, like ships in unsafe anchorage, sway
from their moorings—all are tormented by a spirit
of turbulence which will not let them rest, and men
with weak brains and vacillating purpose are playing
with the destinies of peoples in a wholly unforseeing
and nerveless way, heedless of the fact that there are
other more powerful players behind them who are
about to make an end of their game and push them
far away from the goal. In what I have written,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>ix</span>
however slight and inadequate, I have had but one
aim in view: to hold up to the public as far as I can
or may, the greatness of this beloved land of ours—its
splendid ancient history and tradition, and to
resent, as much as a mere pen can do, the disloyal
and agitating influences which seek to disrupt unity and
belittle the achievements of the noble British people.
Of the wicked waste of that people’s money by the
most obtuse Government methods, and the iniquitous
premium on idleness foolishly given in the “Unemployment
dole,” I could say much, notwithstanding that
I am told it is “a sop to check Bolshevism.” One does
not offer a sop to a mad bull—one kills it. And it is
not credible that the sane, sound men of Great Britain,
with an Empire of glorious renown at their backs,
will ally themselves with Red Riot which means ruin
to themselves as well as to its instigators. True it
is that Stupidity is the present order of the day among
our blind leaders of the blind—that very Stupidity
which Voltaire affirmed to be the only crime—and there
is little else for us to do in our extremity but “wait
and see” whether Stupidity will prove more than a
blundering guide to “where the rainbow ends.”</p>

1913, without any other than instinctive premonition of the coming

<p><span class="smcap">Editorial Note.</span>—<i>Marie Corelli’s remarkable article should be
read by every man and woman at all mindful of the welfare of
their fellow-sojourners on this little swinging ball of ours, which
we call the earth. This contribution is far and away one of the
most brilliant pieces of writing Miss Corelli has ever achieved;
it is thought-compelling and in the larger sense inspirational; it
is wellnigh epoch-making in its new view, its virile logic, its sane
and forceful plea for the peace of the world—peace on a basis of
common sense, broad humanity, and the honour of nations.</i></p></div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Civilisation</span> is a great Word. It reads well—it is
used everywhere—it bears itself proudly in the language.
It is a big mouthful of arrogance and self-sufficiency.
The very sound of it flatters our vanity and testifies to
the good opinion we have of ourselves. We boast of
“Civilisation” as if we were really civilised—just as
we talk of “Christianity” as if we were really Christians.
Yet it is all the veriest game of make-believe,
for we are mere Savages still. Savages in “the lust
of the eye and pride of life”—savages in our national
prejudices and animosities, our jealousies, our greed and
malice, and savages in our relentless efforts to over-reach
or pull down each other in social and business
relations. If any confirmation of such a statement be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>17</span>
needed it is found in the fact that War is still permitted
to exist. War is unquestionably the thrust and blow
of untamed Savagery in the face of Civilisation. No
special pleading can make it anything else. We may
if we like call it “Patriotism” in our perpetual life-comedy
or tragedy of feigning, but in sane moments
we must surely realise that we are wilfully deceiving
ourselves. Patriotism is understood to be that virtue
which consists in serving one’s country; but in what
way is this “Patria” or country served by slaying its
able-bodied men in thousands?—the very men whose
peaceful and progressive toil makes the country worth
living in? Can any adequate answer be given to this
question? Is “Honour” justly due to the heads of
Government who, themselves safely out of the fray,
send such men like sheep to the shambles—men innocent
of all personal or national offence, but who in their
fine obedience to duty and the preconceived idea of
conquest which has its root in old barbaric periods,
consent to be shot down under the murderous fire of
unseen guns miles away, simply because their rulers
have so ordained it? Is it “civilised” to spread ruin
and devastation through the land?—to leave homes
desolate?—and to create a wretched surplus population
of widows and orphans for no other reason than that
one nation refuses to comply with what is demanded
of it by the other? Is it not possible to deal with even
a difficult and refractory subject of quarrel in the way
of reason and argument, brought to bear upon it by
the soberly judging powers of all nations? And if
reason and argument should fail, then, instead of
consigning troops of blameless men to the scientific
but cruelly treacherous methods of modern warfare,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>18</span>
would it not be more normal and humane simply to—Stop
Supplies?</p>

<p>Here we touch a vital centre of the question. No
nation can go to war without Money. In most cases
a very great deal of this same money is required. Who
provides it? The nation itself? One may doubt
whether any nation could raise sufficient funds to
carry on a serious war for any length of time without
borrowing. Supposing this to be the case, what
financial force behind the scenes so obligingly lends
the cash for the purpose of carrying out schemes of
wholesale murder? Wherever such cash is obtained
we know it must be weighted with an exorbitant rate
of interest, so that the price of human blood fills the
pockets of the lenders with a certain guaranteed overflow.
To stop War, therefore, it should be made
impossible to borrow the sums required for warfare;
and any loan started with the object of War in view,
whether suggested or avowed, should be considered
by a National Agreement of United Powers illegal
and even criminal, as conspiring against the peace
and progress of the world. If, by what is called
diplomacy or political subterfuge, this law were cheated,
and vast sums were loaned ostensibly for other purposes
than War, and it could afterwards be proved that
War <em>had</em> nevertheless been, secretly and all along, the
actual purpose of such loans, then the lenders should
be compelled to forfeit all claims to repayment. For
talk fine sentiment and pious platitudes as we will,
the brutal truth is that no war can be carried on without
money—money fully guaranteed—and if we would
strike at the root of the evil, then these guaranteed
supplies must be cut off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>19</span></p>

<p>A well-known journalist who, through his birth
and family connections, may be presumed to have more
than common knowledge of the various financial games
of chess played by the “Chancelleries” of Europe, is responsible
for the statement that “War is popular.”
This is one of those brisk surface sayings that shine
with apparent candour, like the sparkle of light in the
ice on a puddle, but which have no more depth than
the puddle itself. War is temporarily “popular”—so
long as it is confined to its own pomp and panoply—its
martial music, its flying banners, its glittering
array of armed men—its marching and countermarching—its
sensation and “show,” in fact—sensation and
show which appeal to the multitude who are not brought
face to face with the disease and death of its darker
side. The elemental passions of a mob can be roused
as easily by the “savage” beating of a tom-tom as by
the “civilised” roll of the drum, or by the fussy cackling
of an excitable Hen-Press. That Hen nowadays is
always laying eggs of a curiously abnormal nature, in
fact so surprising is its daily product that the maternal
bird is for ever getting off the nest to look at results,
with an evident expectation that mere chicks may turn
out to be swans, though, as a rule, they are generally
geese. To judge from the incessant cackle and scream,
one would imagine them responsible for European opinion,
and occupied in raising “nation against nation,”
with “men’s hearts failing them for fear,” in startling
confirmation of the New Testament prophecy, and some
of us are disposed to ask: Why are sinister and disturbing
suggestions constantly thrown out by the Press
as baits to catch the always restless, dissatisfied and
uneasy minds of the populace? Is Finance the fisher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>20</span>man
behind the tree, angling with a long line and a
devil’s hook at the end of it? No one with a grain of
common sense would call it Patriotism! Our men of
science, our pathologists and physicians have of late
years been studying to some purpose the mysterious
power of “Suggestion”—and if we have sufficient intelligence
to understand the discovered facts which have
rewarded their researches we shall acknowledge that
ideas, started and persistently fostered in the minds
of the million by constant reiteration, frequently
develop into actions. With how much care and
earnestness therefore should we see to it that the
suggestions impressed on the brains of Nations are
sane, pure and noble, moving all progress forward,
with that firm gentleness which is the truest strength,
into the ways of wisdom and of peace!</p>

<p>As “civilised” peoples we continue to exhibit the
strangest barbaric inconsistency in our manners and
methods of justice. If one man or woman is murdered
in our midst our laws are set into instant operation
to find the murderer, and if the crime is brought home
to him he is sentenced to death. But in War thousands
are murdered at the mere signal of “brave” commanders,
and instead of the wrath and horror aroused
by the slaying of a single life, an uproar of jubilation
and triumph breaks out over the poor festering corpses
that strew the field of so-called “glorious victory.”
The “civilised” State protests against the murder of
one individual, but looks upon the ghastly holocaust
of slaughtered lives in battle as something almost
noble and inspiring! Is this reasonable? Is it reconcilable
with sane judgment? Is it any proof that
our “Education” is of real worth?—or does it not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>21</span>
rather testify to the amazing fact that in our greed
of possession, our thirst of conquest, and our curious
conceptions of religion and humanity, we have progressed
scarcely a step ahead of our “barbarian” ancestors
and their “savage” customs!</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is said by certain special pleaders that War is
a Necessity. We are referred for verification of this
to the world of nature, where it would certainly seem
that various tribes of animals and insects do make
war upon each other. These wars, however, occur
much more frequently among the low grades of nature-life
than the high. One may doubt whether eagles
as a tribe make war upon eagles, lions upon lions,
and so forth. That every animal should fight or work
individually for food is the natural law—the spirit
of prey is one from which Man himself is never exempt.
But has any one ever heard of several thousand lions
or bears taking up a stand against each other and
slaying each other wholesale for a disputed portion
of territory? Ants and emmets make continual war
among themselves, but “Civilisation” is supposed to
have set Man a trifle higher than the ant or emmet;
he is even believed to be superior in mental capacity
to the eagle or the lion. He is accredited with fine
faculties of reason, and is more or less conscious of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>22</span>
high spiritual impulses—and in Christian countries
he professes a humane creed, and assumes to teach
the ethics of a divine moral code. During the far-off
periods of his evolution from embryonic animalism
towards the higher potentialities of his being, he was
doubtless forced to fight his way against such opposing
obstacles as threatened to stay or overwhelm him in
his progress, but now—now when he stands, or thinks
he stands, on a height of intellectual power and attainment
which enables him to discard old barbarisms,
surely it would be possible for him to control the
lurking remains of his original savagery! War may
be, as the before-quoted journalist declares, “popular,”
but it might be as well, considering the ruin and misery
which follow in its train, to inquire into the inward
working of its asserted “popularity,” apart from its
deceptive outward display.</p>

<p>First then, as already hinted, there are floaters of
a War Loan. With them it is undoubtedly “popular,”
for it opens several channels for the rapid making
of money. Roughly speaking, most of the money advanced
at interest for all important purposes comes
from the Jews. All nations are more or less under the
thumb of Israel, disguise it as we will, or may. No
great scheme, either in peace or war, can be started
without Jewish gold and Jewish support. The Jews
are the cleverest commercial people on the globe;
they are also charitable and benevolent to a degree
that often shames Christianity. They could, as a
race, do much to stop War in its very beginnings if
they once unanimously and resolutely decided on
such a course of action. But it is not likely that they
will ever pronounce their “veto”; the idea would be too<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>23</span>
Utopian and unbusinesslike. Therefore, as things
exist, it is scarcely unkind to say, that with their race
all over the world War is “popular.” Its commencement,
progress, and continuance are in their hands.
And they will, from a purely commercial point of
view, continue to lend cash for the furtherance and
encouragement of National Savagery, so long as
National Savagery exists, and is willing to borrow
money at a high rate of interest. For with them the
God of Israel is still a God of Battles.</p>

<p>Secondly, War is “popular” with the Press. Unctuous
newspaper articles lamenting the “horror” of War,
and disclaiming all responsibility for fermenting and
agitating the motives of quarrel, are only so much
meaningless “copy.” Useful “copy,” too, because it
conveys to the ingenuous and child-like mind of the
man in the street that the intelligent editors and
journalists who “manage” his news for him are really
peace-loving, unselfish folk, and pious withal. Whereas
the very suggestion of War is a paying “sensation”
for press-men; it gives plenty of opening for big “headlines”
and attractive “posters,” which help to sell their
penny or halfpenny sheets to the best advantage.
Whatever rumour is abroad, whatever whisper of a
“conference of the Powers” flies on the wind, the Press
makes more than the most of both rumour and whisper—and
if it can only work up a national “Scare” it is as
happy as a monkey with a banana. Such a Press as
that of America and Great Britain could not exist
without “sensation.” Even in “piping times of peace”
it resorts to the most ludicrous methods of producing
mild excitements, such as “Sweet Pea” or “Giant
Carnation” or “Photographic” competitions, or a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>24</span>
“Symposium” as to whether milk or fish diet is best
for the brain. A murder is life to it!—while the useful,
brilliant, beautiful or noble work done in Art or Literature
gets scarcely a helpful mention. How often we
see great space given to the description of a public
dancer!—her jewels, her dresses, her opinions!—while
a fine poem or picture is dismissed in a flippant
paragraph. The reason of this is obvious: it is that
many of the persons who assist in the work of daily
journalism are only educated up to the public dancer
standard—the poem or the picture is lost on the
limited area of their abilities. And it may really be
said again without either prejudice or unkindness
that so far as the press is concerned War is “popular,”
because it provides just that particular “sensation”
which in its turn commands sales. Therefore if press-men,
directly or indirectly, do foster national bitterness
or help to stir up strife, we must remember that
they are only serving their own interests, and that
blame is chiefly due to ourselves if we give credence
to their often exaggerated statements. Bismarck is
reported to have said on one occasion, “The windows
which our Press breaks we shall have to pay for!”
This is true enough. Indeed, it is just possible that
if there were no Press at all for a few years many
dissensions would die out, and many unfortunate happenings
would never happen!</p>

<p>But setting aside the two chief forces behind the
scenes, Usury and the Press, with all other commercially
concerned parties in the quarrels of nations,
who <em>can</em> or who <em>dare</em> say that War is “popular”? Let
wives and children answer! Let us try to understand
what we ourselves mean by our conflicting theories<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>25</span>
and arguments—we who make such ado about a
“declining birth-rate,” and fall into hysterical raptures
over a family of “soldier sons”! Let us realise clearly
that the slaughter of able-bodied men materially assists
towards the “declining birth-rate,” and that where
there are “soldier sons” they have been brought into
the world apparently for no other reason than to
be mangled out of it! This is War! Glorious
War! Is it sane? Is it truly “glorious” to shoot down
thousands of human beings who have committed no
fault of their own, but are simply commanded by
their Governments to serve as marks for the bullets
of an enemy who might never have been an enemy
at all but for mischief arising out of idle and often
erroneous report, based on what is perhaps only a temporary
and trivial misunderstanding? The best of
friends are sometimes parted by the stupid gossip of
stupid persons who, envious of happiness and grudging
it to those who possess it, never rest till something
has been done to undermine and destroy it.
In the same way nations are set against each other
by some persistently irritating and ill-founded rumour—some
difference of opinion, which, if taken in
hand reasonably and at once, could be satisfactorily
settled, provided there be not too much talk, “red
tape,” and officialism employed for the purpose of creating
general vacillation and muddle. The conventional
“ifs” and “buts” exchanged among the
Powers may be looked upon with considerable doubt
and foreboding under certain circumstances—an overflow
of fine words not unfrequently means an outbreak
of treacherous deeds.</p>

<p>Unhappily, and in flat contradiction to that “hu<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>26</span>mane”
spirit, which we so frequently profess, treachery
strikes the dominant note in modern warfare, and this
is one of the chief reasons why War should no longer
be permitted. The new long-range quick-firing gun
is as dastardly as it is powerful, for surely to shoot
down men miles away who cannot see their enemies
is as reprehensible and cowardly as to stab a man in
the back unawares. Another instrument of treachery
is the submarine—a truly devilish invention devised
for the avowed object of destroying war-vessels by
murderous action from the hidden depths of the sea.
No one ever seems to pause and consider what an
amount of fiendish cunning in the mind of man has
evolved the construction of this deadly engine of warfare—still
less does the question ever appear to
suggest itself as to whether such a perfidious way of
compassing slaughter is humane (we will not shame
the word “Christian”) or truly “civilised.” If we refer
back to what we are pleased to call the “dark ages”
or ages of barbarism, we read much concerning
“instruments of torture,” such as the rack, the thumb-screw,
and other inventions brutally designed by man
to injure his fellow-man, but these things for the most
part avowed their murderous intention in open daylight—the
doomed creatures knew what they had to
expect and prepared to die accordingly. But modern
science has sharpened our wits to a more merciless
edge—we are cunning enough to hide ourselves and
our instruments of death from our intended victims
after the fashion of assassins lurking in ambush—therefore
by the very law of compensation it is scarcely
to be wondered at that we are sometimes “hoist with
our own petard,” of which the many appalling sub<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>27</span>marine
fatalities are proof and warning. And now,
not satisfied with attack from the secret depths of
the ocean, Zeppelins and aeroplanes shower bombs
upon open towns and innocent civilians, so that even
the hitherto neutral skies will be made spaces of vantage
for pitiless assault. All these “civilised” inventions
for the practice of barbarity ought to give
so-called “Christian” empires food for serious thought—yet,
strange to say, it would seem that every new
and more murderous weapon for warfare is hailed
with columns of praise in the press, and such general
acclamation as may truly be called “savage”—as no
“civilised” community educated according to all that
we boast of in our advanced state of progress, could
or <em>would</em> rejoice over the construction of mere killing-machines
for the slaughter of their fellow-creatures!
Therefore, it may be asked: Are we truly “civilised”
or is it all a Sham? Are we really humane?—or as
bloodthirsty as when, in our aboriginal savagery, we
cracked the skulls of our enemies open with flint axes?</p>

<p>The continued existence of War is, in the face of
all faith and feeling, a shame to the world! So long
as nations are slaves to the barbarous idea that Blood
and Carnage alone can keep them in their places as
authoritative forces for the higher progress and welfare
of Humanity, so long will Civilisation be more or less
a farce. No one denies the self-sacrifice, the endurance,
the patience, and the courage which makes men military
heroes—the pity of it all is that such splendid qualities
of character should be wasted on the mere consummation
of slaughter and conquest. What good
to the world has ever come out of Napoleon’s many
massacres? Looking down upon the sarcophagus con<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>28</span>taining
that Imperial Murderer’s ashes in the gorgeous
tomb consecrated to his memory in Paris, one
wonders sadly why he was ever permitted to live. We
may with the great poet Byron <span class="locked">say:—</span></p>

    <div class="verse indentq">“To think that God’s fair earth hath been</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The footstool of a thing so mean!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>If War is still to confirm us and other nations as
Savages, we must behave accordingly. We must train
our men and youths to kill, and to use the newest
and surest weapons for killing. When we are offered
Dreadnoughts, we accept them with salvos of rejoicing
and thanksgiving. Yet without War these
Dreadnoughts will, in ten years’ time from the date of
their completion, be useless, and the millions they
cost will be sunk into waste material. Must we have
continuous War, then?—just for the sake of employing
Dreadnoughts—and proving to our own satisfaction
that we can slaughter as many innocent thousands
as other Savages if we like? Why should any cause
arise for the visitation of such a scourge upon us or
any nation! If we have foes who show a threatening
front we are naturally bound to be on the defensive—and
we should be prepared to guard our kingdom
and coast from Savages more savage than ourselves.
But when we can get rid of our Savagery
we shall lay down our arms. We shall realise
that Civilisation means Unity; Unity in all high
purpose and progress towards the betterment of
mankind.</p>

in any sense be held accountable for either the Author’s views or
her expression of them.</i></p></div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">“Ye</span> hypocrites! Ye can discern the face of the sky
and of the earth, but how is it that ye do not discern
this time?”</p>

<p>Such was the question put to the people by the
Founder of the Christian Faith two thousand years
ago—a question not yet answered. Lack of discernment
is still as much as ever one of humanity’s chief
attributes, or is it perhaps less a lack of discernment
than an unwillingness to discern? “Ye hypocrites!”
said the Christ. Is it not, after all, sheer hypocrisy
which, in the form of social convention, does so obsess
Man that, though conscious of approaching storm,
he prefers to bury his head, ostrich-like, in a sand-heap
of his own delusions in order that he may be as
blind and as deaf as possible to the lurid glare and wild
uproar of coming disaster? He instinctively knows
disaster is imminent—even at his very doors—and
that it will presently swoop relentlessly down upon
him, perhaps tossing him with other fragments of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>32</span>
creation into a chaos from which he shall scarcely
emerge with a sound skin; yet knowing, he pretends
<em>not</em> to know, and plays the fool with himself and
destiny!</p>

<p>To-day, now, at this very moment, all over the
civilised world, this terrible game of “playing the
fool” is going on with reckless speed and continuity.
I use the word “terrible” advisedly, for nothing more
pregnant with all the elements of positive terror was
ever seen than the present-time spectacle of Human
Humbug set face to face with that Eternal Equity
which has existed always, and which ever will exist
without any change in its Divine Source, Cause and
Intention. Man, endowed with splendid gifts of reason,
imagination and psychic power, is everywhere
gambling away his highest birthright for gold; Man,
whom the celestial forces have led step by step through
carefully measured gradations of intellectual evolution
till he has arrived at the open gateways of Science,
there to behold the infinitely marvellous benefits he
may possess and enjoy, still insults the Giver of all his
good by his fumbling forms of faith and worship suited
only to barbaric minds in a state of embryo—Man,
semi-apathetic and in many cases wholly indifferent
to the higher roads of progress and to the steady unfolding
of that endless perspective of order and beauty
intended for the individual happiness of every individual
soul, still makes wilful havoc of his own carefully
organised civilisations, like a child who builds
a house of cards and blows it down with a breath—and
this because his civilisations are mostly of a flimsy
structure, having no foundation on any fundamental
Law which Nature can or will tolerate for more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>33</span>
a very brief time. All history teaches this with stern
and pitiless repetition; and the signs and portents
which gave warning of the downfall of the Roman
Empire were of precisely the same character as the
signs and portents which warn us of similar downfalls
impending for great nations to-day. The scheme of
Creation is plainly meant to be a perpetual movement
towards perpetual advancement—this truth is clearly
demonstrated in all natural evolution, and Man is perforce
compelled, despite himself, to move with the
onward and upward process—but he invariably “hangs
back” and tries to put a stop on the wheel, with
the result that he is himself crushed and ground
to powder in the wheel’s relentless revolving. He
makes religions, laws and morals for himself which
have no prototype in the order of Nature, and he
thereby stands rebelliously opposed to the Supreme
Intelligence, whose design of life being exact mathematics,
swerves not by so much as the shadow of a
hair.</p>

<p>Hence arises, and always will arise, trouble. Trouble
and unrest! The sum of things never comes right,
add it up, subtract, or multiply as we will. We persist
in our childish efforts to fit in figures which have no
place or part in the Divine quantities. Now and then
in some sudden flash of higher consciousness, we see
the folly of our actions—but seeing, we pretend to
be blind. Some of us devote ourselves to a study of
the sciences, and we peep through a hundred loop-holes
into a vista of shining truths, any one of which
would help us to draw closer to God—yet presently
we turn away and talk of predestination and original
sin, and feign to believe in a Deity whose rage against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>34</span>
His own Creation is so insensate and barbaric as only
to be pacified by Blood! Blood—blood! The cry
of the vengeful, the murderous, the cruel, the tyrannous
in all ages of the world!—yet we do not hesitate to
insult the Creator of the whole Cosmos by endowing
Him with this animal and un-God-like craving! He,
who holds the starry heavens in the hollow of His
Hand—from whose expressed Thought solar systems
are born like blossoms in the fields of ether—He, whose
vast love broods tenderly over all that He hath made,
even to the nesting bird hidden under a bunch of
green leaves—“not one shall fall to the ground without
your Father”—even He it is whom daily we wrong
and blaspheme by our social methods of life and forms
of worship, by our deliberate opposition to His Laws,
and by the amazingly insolent indifference we exhibit
to His inviolate Will as shown through the reflection
of His Mind in visible Nature.</p>

<p>And so it happens that, after a certain space of time
in which we are offered fresh chances of amendment
or betterment which we seldom take, things begin to
go wrong. We know not how or where the mischief
first started, because it has stolen upon us by gradual
and insidious degrees, and we never dream of looking
for the root of the evil in ourselves or in our ancestry.
But we do become slowly and reluctantly aware that
we are not on the right track—that “something” is
about to happen which will upset all our most cherished
plans and push us off our present road of what we are
pleased to call “progress” in a sufficiently disastrous
manner. We have no time to retrace our steps and
look for the way we have missed, for we find that we
are running down hill with a singular self-imposed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>35</span>
velocity which would make any sort of a stop almost
impossible—while to go back would mean to climb a
very steep and difficult ascent, an exercise for which
we are neither prepared nor willing. We have no
idea how we managed the muddle in which we find
ourselves, but muddle it is and muddle it remains.</p>

<p>And then we enter upon the doubtful period—the
kind of period in which the whole world is living to-day—a
period of vague uneasiness, restlessness, and feverish
suspense, looking for we know not what, dissatisfied
with things as they are, yet unable to decide how they
ought to be. Then is the hour of the brazen-mouthed
religious ranter and the political demagogue. The
nations of the earth are disquieted mentally and
spiritually—the pulpit braggart assumes to teach
them, and the upstart in politics offers to reform them.
And like the waves of the sea before a storm breaks,
the people surge to and fro in billowy masses, with
here and there a gleam of hope among them like light
on spraying foam, but for the most part moving in
darkness and deep unrest. For the time is past when
the balm of old tradition can be applied as a soothing
salve to the spiritual wounds of humanity. Men do
not want to be soothed, but roused—fired to
noblest energy, greatest aims and splendid achievement—and
they need to feel that their efforts to reach
the Highest are worth the making, and that the fight
which they enter upon means victory in the end.</p>

<p>This, most unfortunately, is not made plain to them
by either the faiths or followings of modern society.
The Churches have in a great measure lost their hold
upon the people, and the consolidation of family life
is a thing of the past. When England was truly great,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>36</span>
the love of home and country was the chief foundation
of her greatness, as it should be with all nations seeking
to hold high place and power—but in our present
modes of living, both in England and America, “home”
is voted hum-drum and a bore—sons and daughters
openly profess the gad-about principle of what they
term “pleasure,” and are more or less indifferent to
the interests or convenience of their parents, showing
no more reverence or consideration for them than is
necessary to obtain financial “supplies.” They snap
the chain that should bind them to filial tenderness
and duty, and follow their own particular forms of
enjoyment with a cool selfishness which can but
astonish any thoughtful beholder—yet even this
reprehensible attitude of the rising generation is but
a phase of the general “Unrest” pervading all classes
and all ages—the vague sense that nothing is going
to last very long—that some dire mischief threatens
the world—and that one must try to enjoy oneself
while one can, because there is no time left to do anything
else. And well-meaning fathers and mothers,
especially those of the upper classes, adapt themselves
more or less compassionately and with regret to the
new and often exceedingly bad manners of their
children, who, in nine cases out of ten, resemble the
Biblical “daughters of the horse-leech,” crying “Give!
Give!” and regard their progenitors merely as human
banks on which they expect to draw <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad libitum</i> till
the coin gives out. All this is wrong, hopelessly wrong.
Fathers should be supported by their sons, if support
is needed—not sons supported by their fathers. And
in such strange times as these, when women are so
ready to throw off their womanliness and become<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>37</span>
mere roughs in the general fray, they too must be
expected to put themselves in harness and earn the
right to live. They have wilfully destroyed the ideal
of woman, so long and lovingly cherished by man in
the days of sentiment and chivalry—and now they
can hardly wonder if husbands prove difficult to secure.
Men will think a hundred times before entering into
marriage with possible window-smashers.</p>

<p>Yet it is all part and parcel of the one thing—the
Great Unrest which, like a storm atmosphere, envelops
all our modern civilisation. There is no country that
does not feel it—no nation that is not uneasily conscious
of being on the verge of change. The disruption
of family life—the revolt of Woman against her own
nature, and the frenzied ultra-stupidity she exhibits
in the efforts she makes to reverse her own God-ordained
position in the scheme of creation—the
pathetic bewilderment and weariness of Man himself,
left without any of his old ideals of faith or love, and
clinging to gold as the only seemingly tangible good
which may procure him some bodily comfort and
ease, though feeling in his own soul that even this is
little worth—all these things are forerunners of coming
trouble to which we are as yet unable to give a name.
Most notable and most tremendous of all portents,
however, is the earthquake tremor that is shaking the
Churches to their foundations, and the growth and
extension of what is called the “New Thought.” The
New Thought is really the Old Thought—the Thought
which was the underlying germ of the mystic religions
of the East, and the foundation of the Platonic
philosophy. The “Thought” has become overlaid by
a multiplicity of differing human opinions, forming,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>38</span>
as is their habit, into useless and mischievous systems—but
in its pure beginning it is the Christ in embryo—the God-in-Man.
In simplest truth it is an eternal
Thought which by Divine inspiration teaches us that
the Soul or spirit of every human being is an individual
portion of the Spirit of God—and that as such it is
an immortal creature, whose destiny is glorious, whose
splendid faculties are for the purpose of evolving itself
through phases of wide advancement to wider attainment,
and for whom there is and can be no such thing
as death. This Earth is its present school and playground—Nature
is its teacher, as well as its subject
and servant. It is to learn what it can and will by
patient study and grateful experience—it is to use
what it finds in all things pleasant, helpful, joyous,
noble, and gracious—it is to breathe in an atmosphere
of love; and with the Supreme Intelligence of which
it is a part, it may feed as it will among the lilies of
life, and may say, “My Beloved is mine and I am
His.”</p>

<p>This spiritual tie between man and his Maker has
never been sufficiently emphasised by the Churches.
Their religious forms of worship impress upon us that
we are miserable sinners whatever we do, that we
must try to save our souls, and that we must put as
much as we can into the collection-plate. In great
sorrow or difficulty these instructions are not very
helpful. Sometimes indeed we doubt whether God
meant us to consider ourselves such “miserable sinners”
after all. Our perpetual whinings and lamentations
cannot make sweet music on the Divine records. God
gave us our bodies, not to chastise and mortify, but
to care for and make healthy and beautiful; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>39</span>
laws He has framed for our guidance and maintenance
are such that if one be broken, punishment is bound
to follow. There is no forgiveness, because there
simply <em>cannot</em> be any deviation in the mathematical
precision of the universal plan. And the punishment
is measured exactly to the fault. If we refuse to go
forward, we must go back—we are not allowed to
stand still. If a man elects to throw himself headlong
from a steeple, not all the prayers of the saints could
alter the law of gravitation which causes him to fall
and break his neck. What is true of physical law is
equally true of spiritual law, since Matter is simply
Spirit substantiated and made temporarily visible in
endless temporary forms. And all God-ordained laws,
whether physical or spiritual, are framed for the guidance,
benefit, and advancement of creation—whereas
we, by devising other laws which pull contrary to
Divine ways and means, find ourselves “in darkness
and the shadow of death” instead of in light and the
splendour of life. In our day Science has come to our
rescue, and like a great Angel stands at the open door
of the Kingdom of Heaven; she shows us the “many
mansions” of worlds upon worlds in the Father’s House—she
points out the loving care with which even the
tiniest organism of life is protected—she instructs us
how we may press the lightning into our service and
use the waves of the air to convey our messages from
one land to the other—and she impresses upon us,
even as a loving mother impresses a beautiful truth
upon her child, the fact that we—even we—are permitted
to be the rulers of this wonderful planet, so
full of exquisite beauty and joy—and that we are
expected to use the endless gifts bestowed upon us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>40</span>
with love, wisdom and courage, developing ourselves
into a noble race of creatures worthy of ever nobler
and higher issues.</p>

<p>Thus it has come to pass that with Science leading
us ever onward and upward, we cannot any longer
in reason look upon “Our Father” as a capricious tyrant,
needing a sacrifice of blood to pacify His wrath
against us. Instead of this barbarous conception, we
realise that Perfect Justice cannot possibly be angry
with what it has Itself ordained—and we are overpowered
and brought to our knees in devout adoration before
the Great Spirit of Love which is the Generator of
the universe, and which out of smallest beginnings
works to greatest ends—work in which we are permitted,
nay, expected and commanded, to take an active
part, our disobedience always resulting in disaster to
ourselves.</p>

<p>It is the contemplation of these truths which Science
hourly and daily demonstrates to the glory of the Creator
that the “New” or “Old” Thought has arisen
in all its strength, like Christ from the grave, “walking
in the garden in the cool of the day.” Hence the earthquake
tottering of the Churches, and the ever-spreading
great wave of religious unrest. There is, among many
deeply thinking people, an uneasy sense that we have
insulted the real and ever present God by our narrow
and more or less selfish systems of faith, and that we
must hasten to make amends. Therefore, putting
the question of the mentally unfit aside in the general
sorting of the sheep from the goats, it seems evident
that the time is ripening towards a New Revelation
of the Divine in Man—a “sign from heaven” for the
better guidance of the human soul towards ultimate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>41</span>
perfection, and a surer means of obtaining peace and
happiness in this life as well as in the life to come.
But before the sign be given there must and will be
heavy tribulation; “nation rising against nation,
kingdom against kingdom, earthquakes and divers
troubles”—and the very beginning of these “divers
troubles” is upon us now.</p>

<p>Hence the Great Unrest. People scurry to and
fro all over the earth, like ants disturbed on their hill
by a burning match thrown in among them. They
do not know what is the matter, but they feel that
they must keep moving. The sensation of inexplicable
haste is upon them. There is no time for anything.
Pleasure easily palls, and the most agreeable society
develops into boredom. The days of reposeful leisure,
in which the greatest works of art were created, are
ended. Everything must be got through quickly
nowadays—“scamped” as a matter of fact. Sweetness
and harmony in music are no longer admired—it must
be discordant and odd to suit the spirit of the age. Fine
painting is a drug in the market unless it be the work
of an “old master”—a picture must be “sensational”
in colour and in execution to suit the perverted taste
of the day. Literature and the drama must present
“problems” of a questionable nature before their
productions can be pronounced “great” by the very
few critics who are more than ordinary paragraphists—while
Poetry, the highest of all the arts, is practically
dead. The abnormal condition of the human mind
displays itself in costume, manners, and social observances
and over all things hangs the deepening mist
of a universal dissatisfaction for which there seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>42</span>
to be no cause, and for which we can find no
name.</p>

<p>Do we mean to go on blindly, pretending we do not
see? “Ye hypocrites! Ye can discern the face of the
sky and of the earth, but how is it that ye do not
discern this time?”</p>

<p>How is it indeed! For “this time” is one of the most
fated and historic times in the history of the world—a
time when we may perhaps be called upon to witness
the commencement of the downfall of the greatest of
Empires—the British;—when we may have to watch its
magnificent fabric, once the envy of all other nations,
crumbling before our very eyes—its pillars of state
pulled down by riotous demagogues—its splendid traditions
put to shame by both parties in its Parliament—by
the one in sheer outlawry, by the other in no less disgraceful
inaction. We can look on at this and wonder
what new power will arise from its ruins, but we may
not dare to prophesy till after the event! For this is
but “the beginning of sorrows.” It little matters that
the fools and jesters of the hour make mockery of all
those who seek to warn off the misguided people from
the quicksands whither they are rushing—fools and jesters
there have always been and always will be, ready to
toss ribaldry in the face of Deity itself without compunction.
But the evil which darkly threatens modern
civilisation is too near and too evident to be lightly
“laughed down.” Every student of history knows
that when the foundations of religious faith are shaken—when
it becomes “a house divided against itself,”
then national disaster is close at hand. Man, deprived
of any high spiritual ideal of life, quickly reverts to
mere selfish savagery. The Dean of St. Paul’s, called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>43</span>
“the gloomy Dean” by a halfpenny daily, because he
dares to speak truths which are not altogether pleasant
hearing, must have thought long and deeply, and
fully made up his mind as to what he meant when he
said: “It is the duty of the clergy to maintain that
it is ‘other worldliness’ which alone had transformed
and could transform this world”—which means that
it is only spiritual progress which can make material
progress valuable and lasting. The inward enlightenment
and uplifting of the soul or spirit of each individual
man and woman towards the highest and bravest
ideals of life and love, and conformity to the laws of
creation as made plainly visible in Nature, is the only
true civilisation. This lesson is taught by every
scientific truth we are permitted to investigate. It
is not preaching or platitudinism—it is an incontestable
eternal Fact. Our lives on this planet were intended
to be lives of joy, health, beauty, love, and mutual
helpfulness—and where we depart from this intention
we insult and disobey the Creator, whose design is
one of gradual development towards ultimate perfection.
We wrong Him when we call this beautiful world “a
vale of tears”—for our misfortunes and diseases are
chiefly our own fault, and certainly are not His doing.
It is time we stood up with a glad courage, giving
thanks for all the benefits He has showered upon us
without asking for more. Any creed that is selfish and
whining is no creed for the soul that aspires to the
highest progress. If we invite evils upon ourselves
we must expect them to come—nothing will hold
them back if we are trespassers against natural and
spiritual laws. The Reverend H. Mayne Young,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>44</span>
preaching in Westminster Abbey itself, pronounced
the following words with a noble <span class="locked">daring:—</span></p>

<p>“The day is not far distant when, unless the Church
of England freely re-states and re-models her creeds
so as to meet the requirements of the age, she will be
left stranded on the shores of time, while the tide of
this modern life will leave her for ever farther and
farther behind—a sad warning of the inevitable results
of an iron-bound system of worn-out dogmas and lifeless
traditions.”</p>

<p>“Worn-out dogmas and lifeless traditions!” A bold
utterance, but true! And what is true of the Church
of England is equally true of all the Churches in the
world to-day, notably that of Rome. Man, walking
in a darkness of destroyed illusions, is at that point
when he may well exclaim with the Apostle—“Who
will deliver me from the body of this death?”</p>

<p>It needs no gift of prophecy and no special intuition
to see that we are on the brink of some tremendous
change in the destinies of the human race. Everything
points to it—our tottering creeds, our fluctuating
standard of manners and morals. What it is, what
it may be no one tries to imagine. People instinctively
feel they would rather not think too much about
anything, or analyse the condition in which they find
themselves. There is “no time” for it, they say. Why
is there no time? Is the clock of the universe running
down and are the works giving out? Materially
speaking, we know that the slightest tilt of the earth
on its axis would cause a complete redistribution of
its continents and seas, sweeping away every vestige
of civilisation as we now know it. We never consider
this, imagining that such a catastrophe is not possible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>45</span>
Yet God has willed it so before, and may will it so
again. Every physical movement is preconceived
by a mental or spiritual one. The Great Unrest is at
present one of Spirit which will gradually dominate
Matter and move it to equal but louder disturbance.
We spin on our earth in a gathering storm-cloud between
two fathomless gulfs, the Past and the Future—our
Present is the result of the past, and our future
will equally be the work of the Present. We know that
there is a God of Love to serve, and his Nature-laws
to obey, and knowing this, Ourselves alone must decide
whether we <em>will</em> do as we should, or whether we
shall be <em>forced</em> to do as we would not!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_5">THE WHIRLWIND</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> has come at last—that great Storm foretold by
national weather prophets—it has come with all the
devastating force of a fury long suppressed; and the
black cloud has gathered over our heads while yet
we drowsed in a dream of sunshine. With a sudden
thunderous rush, as though a god or a demon should
tread the spaces of the air, heaven has let loose the
whirlwind—the whirlwind of War, and far more than
War—the whirlwind of Destiny. It has come because
it was bound to come, by the Unwritten Law and Code
Invisible. Men of the world who form governments,
make civilisations, and build up empires are always
forgetting this Unwritten Law—the Hand behind
the scenes—the inexorable and eternal forward movement
of the Cosmos, which in its pre-determined
progress overrides their best laid plans and makes
chaotic havoc of their most sagacious intentions.
Yet it is a perfectly straight and simple Law after all—one
that has existed from the beginning of things,
and that will ever exist—the law of Nature, visibly
expressing the Mind of God, and immutably set against
the predominance of evil. It is an output of the
Divine Will, resolving itself easily into common,
even domestic forms, adapted to the needs of individuals
and nations alike. Nature often conducts
herself like a practical housewife bent on spring
cleaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>47</span></p>

<p>“Where there is dirt,” she says, “it shall be removed;
where there is confusion there shall be order.”</p>

<p>And her “cleaning-up” day is invariably a frightful
thing. The noise of her sweeping and scouring resounds
like thunder through the world. It occurs periodically,
marking epochs of history, and we read of its results
in the past with placid incredulity, setting down much
to exaggeration and more to deliberate lying, idly
amused meanwhile at the ridiculous notion, suggested
by certain fools, that any such uproar and disaster
should ever be experienced by Ourselves who have,
so we consider, “advanced” in civilisation and wisdom,
and thereby in self-control—Ourselves whose “culture”
seems to our own judgment a finer and more perfect
attainment than divine justice. The tornado of the
French Revolution, the pitiless ravages of the
Napoleonic wars have appeared to us like a tale that
is told, “full of sound and fury, signifying nothing”—and
we have lazed the time away, getting and
spending, in the peaceful high noon of national prosperity
and contentment, feeling confident that we
should never in our day be shaken from our centre-poise
of complacent self-satisfaction by anything of
larger disturbance than occasional family quarrels
gotten up more for the sake of varying the monotony
of peace than with any serious intent. And now, lo!—the
bolt falls—the vials of wrath and judgment
are opened and poured forth over land and sea—the
whirlwind is upon us, and we who slept are awakened
by its sweeping rage, its rattling rain, its lightning
flashing against our windows of security, and we leap
to our feet, startled but not alarmed—unprepared,
maybe, but not unready. We realise what the storm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>48</span>
means, and we know how to weather it; we are not
afraid—we only wish we had not slept quite so long!</p>

<p>Nevertheless, though our sleep may have been
heavy, it has refreshed our forces and has not diminished
our energies. Our waking is to good purpose. The
very shame we feel at the length of our slumber is
an excellent tonic and invigorates us. Sleep shall
no more weigh down our eyelids—we are alert, strong,
and resolute, even in the midst of the whirlwind.
For it is a storm in which we alone are not involved.
It has swept over a smaller nation than our own, all
undeservedly—a little sister nation with the heart of
a thousand heroes beating in her small bosom—and
her unmerited sorrow has served as the keynote to strike
all that is in us of Character and Conduct. We see
her defaced with blows, insulted and outraged by
ravening cruelties; and the chivalry born from centuries
of martial glory rises strong and full-armed in
every man that claims justice for her wrongs. We of
Britain have not warred for ourselves—our fight is for
the better, broader freedom of the whole world. The
whirlwind has caught us up in the swoop of its revolving
wings solely that we may take our part in the purifying
of the House of Man. And our victory will be
made manifest in the open response to our inward
intention.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The militarism of Prussia is a crime, springing from
old roots of human savagery and barbarism which
should have died long ago. The brutal War, made
treacherous and bloody by new devices of destruction,
the inventions of fine science misapplied, was an
outbreak of stupidity on the part of an obtuse and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>49</span>
stupid set of men, sodden with selfishness and delirious
with a drunken dream of World-Power. The teachings
of Treitschke and Nietzsche are the teachings of egotists
with unsound and ill-balanced brains. Nietzsche went
mad, and howled his philosophies to the walls of the
padded room. Treitschke was covertly insane; like
the “secret drinker” who in public pretends he cannot
touch strong liquor, he assumed to be proud and
sagacious when he was no more than crazily self-obsessed.
He preached the doctrine of Hate, and
no sane man ever did that. The German nation,
accepting this sort of “Kultur” as gospel, accepted the
ravings of the mentally deficient, and, plunging breast-high
into a sea of brothers’ blood, proved itself infected
by the same madness as that which poisoned the veins
of its mad instructors. To any thoughtful student,
looking on at such a frightful, wicked, and overwhelmingly
stupid slaughter of men by machinery there can
be nothing more terrible, more lonely or more accursed
in all the realm of fact or fiction than the figure of
the Kaiser—the miserable epileptic who is responsible
for shrouding his “Fatherland” in the black veil of
mourning, and for drowning its peace and progress
in a flood of widows’ and orphans’ tears. Mentally
unbalanced, physically inefficient, and morally lacking—living
as one pursued by the Furies in an armoured
cage, and surrounded by guards on earth and in air, lest
by chance his “Gott” should kill him, he moves one to
amazement and pity—for the whirlwind has him in
its centre, twirling him round and round like a veritable
mannikin of sport for the dread gods of destiny—a
mannikin who hardly knows how he came to be where
he is, or where he will find himself when the storm is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>50</span>
past. Meanwhile his voice is heard above the storm
shouting “To England! England! The one foe! My
Mother’s land, which I hate! Would that every drop
of British blood in my veins might be drained out
of me!”</p>

<p>Well, why not? A calf has been bled before now,
and not a drop of its mother’s blood has been left in
its carcase—there is nothing to prevent this desirable
consummation for the Kaiser since he so devoutly
wishes it. The whirlwind may strip him yet, and
perform this required kindness! But in the interval
the arrogant and half-crazed “War Lord” has sacrificed
the best flower and strength of Germany’s manhood
to his criminal and insatiable lust of power. The
German people have not yet realised the mercilessness
of this military despot—but when they do—when they
count the desolate homes, the ruined trades, the lost
commerce, the ravaged lives and broken hearts which
mark the “triumph” of the stagey and spectacular
“hero” they have worshipped, there will be an end of
the blind credulity with which they have followed a
vain ideal.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>For us British, the Whirlwind is a grand thing.
It is blowing us fiercely clean of Self—it is tearing away
from us the silly sophistries of fashion and frivolity
and showing us things in their true light. Our ape-like
jesters of the press, of the Bernard Shaw type,
who have mocked at all things holy, serious, and earnest,
are finding their proper level, and shrinking into corners
where they are scarcely seen—where it is to be hoped
they may be peaceably forgotten. Our “sex-problems,”
our “advanced” women, our screaming Doll Tear-sheets<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>51</span>
of militant suffrage—these trouble the air no more with
the hysterics which are engendered by having nothing
useful to do. We have no time for trifling. We are
face to face with the long-despised Obvious—“Life is
real, life is earnest”—and we are casting off the slough
of political humbug and social sham, and are as one
in the splendid bond of patriotism and love of country.
We may trust the Storm; we may welcome the Whirlwind.
It has come to clear the sky of miasma and
vapour—it is making light to show us where we truly
stand. If we are honest with ourselves we shall admit
that in latter years we have given ourselves over-much
to the pursuit of material gain and personal pleasure,
we have neglected our faith in divine and high ideals,
and Self has been more or less our god; it was time
that we received a wholesome check and a warning
before we lost all that has made us great. We have
responded swiftly to the goading spur—our crust of
selfishness was but thin after all, and has broken and
melted away in a flood of magnificent generosity and
practical sympathy—for never had nation a nobler
Cause than ours, when, as brothers in arms with our
brave allies, we fought to right the unspeakable wrongs
of unoffending Belgium, and to aid in defending France
from the invader and usurper. Should the enemy conquer
in this mighty struggle the whole world will be
the impoverished loser; should we and our allies win,
the whole world will gain by our victory and share
with us a wider, nobler freedom than before. It is for
this cause that the Whirlwind has come upon us—to
cleanse a cancer from our midst, and to put away from
ourselves and our neighbours the dread contamination
of a disease involving the whole trend of civilisation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>52</span>
We may thank God for it, despite all its terrors, its
rain of blood, its thunders of the air and sea, its
swift death dealt to thousands of innocent souls—it is
a storm that was needed to clear the air. And when
it is past, and the sun shines once more, we shall realise
that its causes were to be found not in one nation
only, but in many—in ourselves as well as in our foes—and
that some great and forceful movement of destiny
was urgently called for to sweep away from humanity
the accumulating mass of its own self-wrought evil.
And if victory should be ours, it will behove us to take
it with all humility, giving thanks to God—“<em>lest we
forget</em>!”</p>

<span class="subhead">A CRIME OF STUPIDITY<br />

<span class="subhead">(<i>First published in the “Sunday Times”</i>)</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> every great national crisis, when war or revolution
brings havoc on existing civilisation and works sudden
and violent change in all social, political, and diplomatic
relations, we are invariably able to discover One
Man—or at the most, perhaps, two or three men—primarily
responsible for the general upheaval.</p>

<p>History is impressively explicit concerning these
personages. She never fails to show us how, by some
strange lack of the most ordinary foresight and common
sense, they stumble when apparently on the height
of success, and commit irreparable blunders which
hasten their careers to a disastrous close. Such was
the case with Napoleon and many other would-be
Alexanders of ambition; but of all the tragic blunderers
of time surely none can equal or surpass the “War
Lord” of Germany. Here is a man who had the splendid
chance of securing for his country and people the
largest share of the commerce of Europe; it lay easily
within his grasp. Yet he has let it go, like a handful
of sand and shells dropped by a child at play on the
seashore. To satisfy the personal cravings of a vaunting,
blustering Egoism for blood-and-thunder “effects” he
has lost the peaceful conquest of a world!</p>

<p>Amazing, deplorable, and incredible folly!—when
such conquest could have been gained without a blow,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>54</span>
without the boom of a single gun, without the explosion
of a single shell! It could have been attained in the
only way by which any truly “civilised” nation should
ever seek supremacy—through the development of industry
and commerce, and the quiet assumption of
the power that industry and commerce give. All that
we call “progress” should fortify the stand of human
resolution on this basis. It is not necessary, it is
not even sane or decent that any peoples should tolerate
what Carlyle describes as “the spectacle of men with
clenched teeth and hell-fire eyes hacking one another’s
flesh, converting precious living bodies and priceless
living souls into nameless masses of putrescence, useful
only for turnip manure”—which is a rough but accurate
picture of war deprived of all its devilish excitement
and glamour.</p>

<h3>WASTED OPPORTUNITY</h3>

<p>To Kaiser William more than to any other monarch
of his time was given the glorious chance of becoming
the greatest benefactor of Germany which that realm
had ever known. He could have created for his people
such conditions of peace, happiness, and prosperity
as were almost incalculable. He stood in the broad
sunshine of ripening trade—the markets of the world
were open to him—fields of wealth were spreading
around him on all sides, and his cheerfully working
millions had but to reap the grain their industries had
sown and gather in a rich and plenteous harvest. Why,
then, in the name of all that is great, noble, and pitiful,
did he choose to make a harvest of death instead of
life?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>55</span></p>

<h3>A TRAGIC WITNESS</h3>

<p>During the grim and ghastly struggle at Verdun
we are told the Kaiser, standing “at safe distance,”
watched through his field-glasses the fiery mowing
down of his countrymen to the number of forty-five
thousand! Does any one, reading this, take the trouble
to pause and consider what it means? Forty-five thousand
strong, brave men in the flower of manhood (for
let us hope we are none of us so unjust as to deny our
enemies their strength or their courage); forty-five
thousand capable human beings fit for every sort of
industrial labour—the blood and bone of future generations—slaughtered
like vermin; and their Emperor,
their sworn Defender and Protector, within sight-range,
looking on!</p>

<p>What a “Harvest Home”! Are we able to conceive
the nature and temperament of a monarch who <em>could</em>
so look on at this massacre of his subjects and not
rush among them to stop the advance of their serried
ranks and “massed formations,” resulting in such a
wanton and wicked waste of life? The crazy antics
of Nero were mere child’s play compared with this
callous attitude of William of Hohenzollern; an attitude
which even his French foes cannot maintain. For,
fired with vengeance for old wrongs as they are, and
bent on victorious justice, they have declared themselves
“sick with slaughter.”</p>

<p>“Such hecatombs,” writes Colonel Rousset, “cannot
last. Our adversary, while carrying his disregard of
human life to the point of madness, cannot go on
throwing his soldiers into the charnel-house without
thinking of to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>56</span></p>

<p>The losses of the Germans at Verdun have been
estimated at 10,000 per day! “I dream at night,”
writes one French artillery officer, “of those ghastly
crumpled heaps of shattered gray-green bodies! Germany’s
wives and mothers must curse the Kaiser in
their prayers!”</p>

<h3>THE CRIME OF STUPIDITY</h3>

<p>Voltaire is accredited with the saying that “the only
crime is stupidity.” According to this dictum one
must come to consider the “All-Highest War Lord” the
greatest criminal of an epoch, his stupidity being almost
without parallel in history. What man, not entirely
mad, seeing a world of prosperity within reach of
his hand would clench his fist and knock the whole
splendid sphere away from him at one blow! The proposition
seems absurd and untenable, yet it has been and
continues to be the Kaiser’s policy, or the policy of
his ministers and advisers; clear to all save those
who remain perversely and wilfully blind.</p>

<p>For it is not too much to say that before the war
Germany was pushing quietly but surely through
every branch of commerce. From triumph to triumph
she moved easily onward; everywhere her ramifications
were spreading like the vigorous roots of a fast-growing
tree. In Great Britain she had possessed
herself of many of our trades; her goods were everywhere;
her cutlery, her glass, her woollens, her linens,
her dyes, her silver and copper ware, her chemicals—why,
even our very window-frames were “Made in
Germany”! She was at work in our mines and coal-fields;
she was ahead of us in science, in invention,
in industry and general “thoroughness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>57</span></p>

<p>And let us not forget that we were, or appeared to
be, supinely indifferent to her inroads on all that we
used to claim as our “special line” and particular
property. We were, like Hamlet, “growing fat and
scant of breath.” We were disposed to indolence and
self-indulgence, and, when we saw Germans working
<em>for</em> us, and <em>by</em> us, and <em>through</em> us, taking the very tools
out of our listless hands, we were agreeably convinced
that they saved us a deal of trouble. They worked
so cheaply, too!—and cheapness in necessary goods
appealed to us, because it gave us more to spend on
racing and football. The “Space for Special News”
in our Press was not reserved (as intelligent foreigners
conceive it ought to be) for serious information on
world’s business; but for “Football Results” or cricket,
in the respective seasons of these gamesome athletics—and
the very word “patriotism” was laughed out of
court as “Jingoism.” We gave the honours of heroes
to our tennis champions, and played about while the
Germans worked. They worked—as many of the
British refuse to work; they saved—as many of the
British decline to save; they gained their ends, because
by our very inertia we gave them every opportunity
to do so.</p>

<h3>BRITISH APATHY</h3>

<p>Mr. Hughes, Prime Minister of Australia, said in a
recent speech that Germany “had abused our foolishly
generous hospitality.” This is not quite accurate,
since we were neither so generous nor hospitable as
careless and lazy. We allowed our trades to slip
through our fingers—the State did nothing for native
work, science, or invention—and ambitious men of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>58</span>
hope and endeavour left the country in shoals to make
fortunes in other lands, <em>many firms establishing themselves
in Germany in order to win the rewards denied
them in their native home</em>!</p>

<p>Germany held a more tenacious grip on every corner
of the earth than we in our latter “go-as-you-please”
way ever realised. All over the United States, Canada,
and Australia her people have spread; you find them
in India, in Persia, in Egypt, in Africa; as a matter
of fact, there is no country where German influence
has not been actively at work while other nations
looked on. Antwerp itself was wellnigh possessed
by German commerce before its military bombardment;
it was already a centre of German trade and
German shipping, and in many of its business houses
more German was spoken than either French or
Flemish. Great Britain was lagging behind in the
race; and had peace been maintained for another
twenty-five years Germany might easily have mastered
the world; and we might have lost all leading hold
on commerce.</p>

<p>For let us not delude ourselves on the subject of
our own inertia! It is owing to the magnificent stand
made for justice and right by the hero-King of Belgium
that we have been awakened from long apathy; had
it not been for his resolute example, both France and
England would have suffered far more than they are
suffering now! Friend and Defender of both nations,
he stands out as the noblest figure in the struggle—the
one who, when victory sits upon our helm,
must be the first to receive that which is due
to him: the restoration of his country and his
throne.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>59</span></p>

<h3>LOSS AND GAIN</h3>

<p>And now the rivers of gold that were flowing into
Germany through her trade are stopped, “damned
up” as the sensational special correspondent would
say—by British, French, and German dead! The
latest estimate of German losses at Verdun is two
hundred thousand! Does the Kaiser, at safe distance,
still “look on”? What blessing has this monarch of
a great and productive realm brought upon his people?
Mourning, desolation, and irremediable misery! No
triumph, no victory can atone for such a deluge of
blood and tears! That capricious Personage “somewhere
in Heaven,” whom Wilhelm calls “Unser Gott,”
may possibly resent the deliberate casting away of
golden opportunities on the part of his crowned earthly
“familiar,” to whom a peaceful world was offered,
only to be kicked aside for a battered helmet and
broken sword!</p>

<p>“Thrust in thy sickle and reap!” O Emperor of a
brief and bitter day! The harvest of death, not life!—the
harvest of curses, not blessings! The thousands
of dead men—dead in the very strength of manhood—sacrificed
in a holocaust on the flaming altar of the
wickedest war the world has ever seen, may have
their own story to tell to “Unser Gott”; so may the
bereaved and wretched women whose husbands and
sons have been torn from their arms for ever. May
the true God help them all!—for in the unspeakable
hell of iniquity around us man is wellnigh powerless;
though, like every evil thing, war has its good side.
It shows us with each day heroism of the finest, courage
of the strongest, self-sacrifice of the noblest, existing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>60</span>
among us all; and it has reawakened the higher spirit
of England. For this we have cause to be devoutly
thankful! In a certain sense it has saved us from
ourselves; and from the enervating love of pleasure
and personal avarice which was slowly undermining
our better qualities.</p>

<p>And even the Kaiser, “looking on” at the legions of
his own subjects falling like withered leaves in a whirlwind
of fire, may one day shake off his frenzied nightmare
of battle, and repent—exclaiming with <span class="locked">Judas:—</span></p>

<p>“I have sinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent
blood!”</p>

</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">What</span> can be said or thought of it? This wonderful
massing of nations—this appalling slaughter of men—this
relentless rolling on of a Divine Elemental
Force, too vast and powerful and resolute for humanity
to resist! It is a War so terrible, yet withal so grand,
and so pregnant with infinite issues that we, who are
swept by the dust and carnage of its fighting millions—we,
who are stunned by the clash and clamour of
the frightful weapons of modern science which it uses
on land, under sea, and in air, are more or less incredulous
and stupefied, and we have been only with
difficulty aroused to try and understand its fateful
import. It is Destiny in labour; and the pangs and
throes of her child-birth will give us a New World!
For the Old World is fast crumbling and crushing
down upon us like an ancient ruin struck by lightning-flash
and thunderbolt; the old vices, lusts, and littlenesses
are being torn away from us as a storm-wind
tears away the parasite ivies from mouldering walls—and
we shall presently see a break in the clouds and
light through the darkness. This thing of terror and
confusion Was To Be; it Had To Be! It has been
coming upon us slowly, but steadily, for years—and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>62</span>
if we are honest with ourselves we shall admit that we
have felt its approach instinctively in a general sense
of insecurity—in a feverish impulse of haste to live
lest we should suddenly die!</p>

<p>Something—we know not what—a cloud or a blight—has
visibly lowered over the face of European
civilisation, and in order to set aside certain strange
and perplexing inconsistencies of such conduct among
us as might induce us seriously to Think—we have
flung ourselves eagerly into a vortex of “sensations”
new and old, bad and good, virtuous and vicious,
with a kind of furious recklessness, bordering on
insanity. Any lapse of morals, any bizarre or weird
“craze” in art, any indecency in literature, has been
acclaimed and encouraged as “new” and “strong”
instead of being condemned for being old and weak
as such things truly are—and in many vital matters
the nation has been moved by a petulant spirit of
selfish, restless irritability, like that of a querulous
old man who has neither the grace nor the courage
to accept his age with wisdom, sweetness, and dignity.
And among various mad things we have done, one
stands out pre-eminently as the maddest—and that
is the tacit encouragement given by a section
of society and the press to a brood of Atheists,
who have trailed their poisonous slime along the
pathways of peace where the youth of this</p>

<p class="in0">have wandered unsuspectingly, gathering the ugly

Never did a sin of this nature occur in the history of
nations without Divine punishment inflicted, not so
much to destroy as to purify. The chronicles of every
civilisation ever known or heard of bear unswerving
testimony to the truth that whenever a nation or a
people assumes to itself Divine right, dismissing from
its mind and conscience the idea of any higher Supreme
Power before Whom it should humiliate itself daily
with thanksgiving and prayer, that nation or people
has been allowed to follow the lure of its own intellectual
pride and self-sufficiency to inevitable disaster.</p>

<h3>IDEAL WORTH FIGHTING FOR</h3>

<p>This is, and this will be, the case with Germany.
For years her people have willingly listened to the
teachings of egoists and madmen such as Treitschke
and Nietzsche—for years they have scoffed at Christianity,
its Founder and its ethics; and they have
tempted the Divine Spirit in Man with the devil’s
whisper, “All these things will I give thee if thou wilt
fall down and worship me!” But that Divine Spirit
is stronger than all Germany and its rulers; and “Get
thee behind me, Satan!” is the keynote of this great
War. The Satan of ambition, greed, and cruelty
embodied in the creed of Prussian militarism must be
driven “hence”; and it is for this holy Cause that we
and our Allies are fighting. We must have a free
world!—free in the sense of highest, purest freedom—a
world of ideas, thoughts, and deeds built up on
the golden law of Christ, “Love thy neighbour as thyself.”
As a statesman has so nobly expressed it:
“We wish the nations of Europe to be free to live<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>64</span>
their independent lives, working out their own form
of government for themselves, and their own national
development, whether they he great nations or small
States, in full liberty. This is our ideal.”</p>

<p>An ideal worth fighting for—worth dying for!—this
“glorious liberty of the free!” None of us would
grudge life or fortune to attain the splendid goal in
sight—a radiant vision of the true “Holy City,” where
as we are told—“the nations of them which are saved
shall walk in the light of it, and the kings of the earth
do bring their glory and honour within it.”</p>

<h3>POISONOUS TEACHING</h3>

<p>Glory and honour never accompany the creed of
selfish Materialism, which is the “Kultur” of Germany.
What a miserable man was he who wrote down in
cold blood these words: “I condemn Christianity.
To me it is the greatest of all possible corruptions.
I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great
intrinsic depravity, the one immortal shame and
blemish in the human race!” This was Nietzsche—poor,
sickly, egoist, Nietzsche! He died mad—yet
he was the “guide, philosopher, and friend” of modern
Germany! How has his teaching worked? Let the
slaughtered thousands of his countrymen on the battlefields
reply. And let us take heed that we in our
turn be not infected by the poisonous breathings of
such insanity! Our nation—our Imperial Britain—has
been dangerously far along the road to similar
madness—let us hope devoutly that we have been
pulled up in time! But—“we have done those things
which we ought not to have done”—as, for example,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>65</span>
we have thrown the sneer of “Jingoism!” contemptuously
in the face of many an honest patriot—and now we
are loud in our expressions of wrath and astonishment
at the “want of patriotism” displayed by certain tribes
of working men who “strike” for more pay, indifferent
to the country’s needs! What have these working
men been taught for the last twenty years? Why,
that Money is the only god, and Self the only master!
When we reproach them for unpatriotic conduct, we
should reproach ourselves still more for the encouragement
and applause we have systematically
given to every new or revived doctrine of selfishness
and materialism that ever infected the world with
its sickly symptoms of decay. Patriotism is a mental
and spiritual attitude—as heroism is—as love and
faith are. Such things cannot be taught; they are
the result of ennobling influences brought to bear on
life and its environment. Considering how little our
educational system holds of such subtle and delicate
training, we have reason to be proud of the splendid
response of our men throughout the Empire to the
call of “King and Country,” and of the real national
“grit” which in every Briton underlies his surface
show of levity and indifference.</p>

<p>But have I, as a woman, nothing to say of the war,
save in its ethical aspect? Oh, yes! I, as a woman,
could say much, in a woman’s way. Of the agony of
parting from men dearer to us than life, and seeing
them disappear behind a veil of impenetrable silence
for weeks or months, their fate or fortune all unknown!
I could weep all day and night for the cruel loss of
young and gallant lives crushed out and left bleeding
and festering on the awful fields of contest—and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>66</span>
long to speak words of consolation and hope to the
dear women who wait in strained suspense for news
of their husbands, fathers, lovers, and sons! I know
all they feel; and the aching throb of their unuttered
misery strikes on my own heart with keenest pain!
But with all the sorrow and all the suffering, I would
not, if I could, hold back one man from taking his
share in the noble struggle for the betterment and
future peace of the world! One can die but once;
and “Greater love hath no man than this—that a man
lay down his life for his friends!”</p>

</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> words “people” and “popular,” viewed by academic
dark-lanterns of literature, are opprobious epithets.
Any person designated as “popular,” or favoured
by “the People,” falls at once outside the pale of
mutual-admiration societies—<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ergo</i>, is not an academic
dark-lantern for the blind to lead the blind, so that
both fall into the ditch. Yet it is well understood that
those who affect to despise the People and “popular”
opinion are the very ones most influenced by both,
inasmuch as not one among them but knows that in
the long run the People alone are the arbiters of national
destiny. Sometimes it hardly appears as if it were
so—yet so it is. Though at this present fateful moment
of time it would seem that the People of the British
Empire are stricken dumb. They are a voiceless
multitude, rendered inert by the knowledge that if
they speak every effort will be made to silence them,
and that though they have much to ask they will not
be truthfully answered. For they are only “the People”!—the
ruck of taxpayers—the grist that goes to the
mill!</p>

<p>But what a People! Consider them as they are
to-day, straining every nerve and sinew in the work
necessary for the carrying on of a wicked and barbarous
world-war, wherein they truly, <em>as</em> a People, sought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>68</span>
and desired no part, but into which they were plunged
unsuspectingly, without fair warning or honest preparation;
and now, being involved in the struggle
for justice and right, do most nobly acquit themselves—a
People who are giving up their sons, their life-blood,
their All for which they have worked through
years of anxious toil—a People who, when their little
harmless children are torn to shreds by enemy bombs
falling from hitherto beneficent skies, are told by a
fatherly Government that “no material damage was
done by the raid”—a People who are cozened with
lies and flattered by false news—a People who in the
gallant thousands of their slaughtered men are dying
that Britain may live!—or, shall we venture to say, that
Cabinet Ministers may “take their salary and continue
to take it!”—an historic utterance which will ring
through the vault of posterity like Nelson’s “England
expects”—only with something of a difference! How
long will this splendid People endure in sheep-like
patience what the Press justly calls “Waste and Muddle”
in high places, without giving vent to their forcible
but natural outburst known as “popular” feeling?</p>

<p>We read in one of the columns of a sane and non-party
daily journal the following:—“No one can say
that the nation is satisfied with the way it is governed.”
This expresses in one clear phrase the apparent situation.
The word “apparent” is used advisedly, for in
many spectral things of recent statesmanship some of us
feel with Macbeth that “Life’s but a walking shadow.”
The present Government, being of a sometimes severe,
sometimes indulgent parental character, seems to
look upon the public, or “the People,” as a sort of
promising Child, that sits quietly waiting to be told<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>69</span>
things, no matter whether the things are false or
true. Wedged in a nursery chair with a bar across
its bulgy waist to prevent it tumbling out on the floor,
this Child is supposed to smile and suck its finger
all day long in a state of blissful belief in nonsense
rhymes and fairy tales. It is a wonderfully good
Child, and Papa Government is pleased to find how
easily it can be played with. Its simplicity is delightful!
Things printed in large type catch its eye and
tickle its fancy, because occasionally (though more in
the past than in the present) it fancies that large type
means something of national importance. But with all
its guilelessness it has a vast amount of natural intelligence,
and it begins to understand that it is not, and
never will be, allowed to learn the drift of Governmental
tactics, or the true state of parties in politics. It is hazily
becoming aware that it is kept in its nursery chair
to be gulled, not to be enlightened. In happier moments
it has shown that it likes to be amused, thrilled,
startled, horrified, or moved to indignation, and, so
far as the “Censor” permits, the gagged and bound
Press tries to do its best on these lines, and dances
for its entertainment as well as a poor bear in chains
<em>can</em> dance, though growling <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sotto voce</i> all the while!
But, considered as a Child, the public is not thought
fit to be told the truth. Its opinion on national affairs
is neither sought nor wanted; all that is required of
it are Silence and Obedience. These it gives, with
what result? Why, as Mr. Asquith said, “Wait and
see!”</p>

<p>Yet surely the waiting is long? “All we like sheep
are gone astray;” but possibly we have been led
astray more than we have gone of our own accord.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>70</span>
All peoples have a certain sheep-like tendency; they
follow a lead. Where the leader goes the flock goes
likewise. This is sometimes set down as evidence of
weakness, but with the British people it marks both
duty and discipline, obedience to law and order, love
and maintenance of home and country. Yet—let us
suppose NO leader! That is—NO leader capable of
leading anywhere save into quagmires and pitfalls of
“Waste and Muddle”!</p>

<p>Rumour has it that on our East Coast the inhabitants
have been “prepared” for a “German landing,”
and have been told where to go inland as “refugees.”
Whether true or false, such a report should never have
gained currency; the word “refugees” should never
be even whispered as likely to be applicable to British
subjects. Similarly on the East Coast it is openly
said that during the last enemy air-raid two Zeppelins
were “within easy gun-shot” and could have been
brought down, but that our anti-aircraft men were
“<em>forbidden to fire</em>.” By whom? Ah! There we touch
upon secrets not to be disclosed by Papa Government
to any inquiring Child! Though when half a secret
comes to light the other half is not far behind! Let us
not forget the warning given by the greatest of all
<span class="locked">Teachers:—</span></p>

<p class="p1 b1 center">“A man’s foes shall be they of his own household.”</p>

<p>It is idle to deny that there are traitors in our own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>71</span>
camp; men of position and influence who are more
pro-German than British—who would not scruple to
pave the way to any dishonour provided they could
serve their own personal ends. Is any one so intellectually
blind and bereft of common sense as to
suppose that even with certain of our statesmen
financial interests do not outweigh their patriotism?
Time is a merciless revealer of facts, and in its record
of this war some strange things will be written!</p>

<p>To those who have eyes to watch and brains to
understand, the advent of Mr. Hughes, Premier of
Australia, is a wonderful, almost touching, circumstance.
Here is a Man at last!—a man who loves
his country and is not afraid to say so—a man who
appeals to the right spirit of the nation straightly and
truly, with courage and conviction. “The People”
answer to his voice: that “People” whom snobs abhor!
Snobbery is apt to speak of the fine Younger Race of
Imperial Britain as “Colonials,” with a touch of contempt,
as though they represented something small
and negligible, instead of embodying as they do the
future power and stability of the Empire. This
“Colonial” Prime Minister shows strength, boldness,
and sincerity; he is a leader, and “All we like sheep”
are disposed to follow him, if he can show us a way
out of the thickets where we wander, torn and bleeding.
Pray Heaven he be not wearied by specious talk, or
repelled by still more specious hypocrisy! or hampered
and discouraged by the working of the “wheels within
wheels” which move with such secret and perplexing
intricacy, crushing honest effort and smothering honest
speech! Surely the British people can be trusted to
know what their foes know, what their Allies know,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>72</span>
what America knows? Are they alone to be deceived?—even
into purchasing goods “from America” which
are German? Mr. Hughes needs to speak yet more
forcibly; he must rouse the slothful and the unthinking,
and tell them that if they would conquer their skilful
and insidious Teuton foe, they must equally conquer
themselves; and that when the markets are open for
British labour, British labour must not fall back in
energy or stint its output. Business must go hand-in-hand
with industry and quickness, for “the race is
to the swift and the battle to the strong!”</p>

<p>“All we like sheep” are waiting, not for compromise,
but for conquest; conquest full, splendid and lasting!
The “People” are patient and submissive enough, but
they seek to put their confidence in a Government
that shows confidence in itself. If they feel that they
cannot do this, what then? Should not the following
words of Carlyle be <span class="locked">remembered?:—</span></p>

<p>“Urge not this noble, silent People. Rouse not the
Berseker rage that lies in them! Do you know their
Cromwells, Hampdens, their Pyms and Bradshaws?
Men very peaceable, but men that can be made very
terrible! Men, who like their old Fathers in Agrippa’s
days, have a soul that despises death; to whom death,
compared with falsehoods and injustices, is light!
Yes, just so godlike as this People’s patience was,
even so godlike must its impatience be!”</p>

<span class="subhead">AN APPEAL

<span class="subhead">(<i>Written for the London “Daily Chronicle”</i>)</span></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Women!</span> You are wanted by the Nation! In the
words of the recruiting posters “Your Country calls!”
It calls even <span class="smcap">You</span>—you, who for centuries have been
the “weak vessels” of man’s passion and humour, are
now needed to strengthen man’s hands in the terrific
business of a world’s battle. You have helped them
already; but you must help them still more. Now
is the day and hour to prove your “undaunted mettle,”
and not only your mettle but your generosity, your
magnanimity, your forgiveness! For in peace times
man has denied you the very possession of ordinary
common sense; he has thrust you out of intellectual
and academic honours; he has grudged you any place
in art, literature or science, and he has made you the
butt of every cynic, comedian, and caricaturist ever
since he arrogated to himself the “everything” of life.
You have been and are the grist to the mill of the
comic press; your fathers have often been glad to
sell you in the marriage market to the highest bidders;
your lovers have played with you and deserted you
as bees the flowers whose honey they have stolen;
your husbands have often been faithless and perjured;
and in certain of man’s legal forms, you have been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>74</span>
classed with “children, criminals, and lunatics,” but
now!—now, you are wanted!</p>

<p>You, so often despised, are prayed not to return
scorn with scorn; you, with your patience, doggedness,
and strongly determined zeal for attainment, are
asked to come forward in your willing thousands, and
let the men go! For the cry is “havoc!—and let slip
the dogs of war!”—war, bitter, merciless, bloody and
more savage than the crudest wars of ancient days;
war in the air, on the earth and under seas—war that
is as stupid, as blind, as criminal and as selfish as are
all the acts which men commit when they have so
far brutalised woman as to check and restrain her
highest impulses, kill her idealism, obstruct her intellectual
aspirations, and treat her as the slave and
tool of a degrading animalism. Had they from the
first dawn of civilisation made her their mental and
spiritual equal, by this time there would have been
no wars. Her love would have constrained and educated
them, her instincts guided them, her inborn
maternity shielded them from the wrongs their ambitions
and jealousies persuade them to wreak upon each
other. Now, in the very midst of the combat which
they have brought upon themselves, they are caught
within a black cloud of almost superhuman disaster,
where but one ray of the veiled sun shines through—that
Divine sense of Justice for which all true peoples
are bound to fight if indeed they be not wholly given
over to the devil of Materialism.</p>

<p>In this, women are, and must be, with them; they,
who from the legended days of Eve have laboured
under the sense of utter injustice, will be eager to
help in any struggle for the Right against Might,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>75</span>
because it is their own cause—the very essence of
their own existence.</p>

<p>Right against Might, women! Be with the men
now in their manliest, most pressing time of action!
Forget their petty carping and cavilling at “the female
element” in workmanship and endeavour; laugh at
the rough and childish hands that beat and batter
the woman’s breast with all the petulance of spoilt
children; fling every other thought aside but the will
and intent to help them on to victory! Make, and
buckle on their armour—let your hands prepare them
for both attack and defence. Nothing nobler will you
ever find to do than this!</p>

<p>In old Arthurian legends, many were the fair women
eager to buckle on the armour of the peerless Knight
Lancelot; but to-day there are a million and more
Lancelots in the field—young, brave, dauntless—heroes
all! Arm them, women!—and by arming them,
defend them! Thousands of you, strong and willing,
are already at work—but we want thousands more!
Even you “toy-women” who dance half-nude o’ nights
at restaurants and in basement saloons of “fashionable”
hotels, wreaking a sly vengeance on men by poisonous
lure and seduction, even you can be brave and helpful
if you will! Give up your foolish sensualities, and
take to sturdy, sensible Work; wash the paint from
your cheeks, the dye from your hair, and clothe yourselves
as fit women who mean to help, and not to
destroy men.</p>

<p>And you, too—you who turn your private homes
into “Bridge Clubs” where “officers on leave” may
become members “without the payment of a fee”—rookeries,
where silly young subalterns are “rooked”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>76</span>
indeed, of every penny, losing not only cash but honour—can
you not give up this unprincipled and unwomanly
“way of doing business” and come out of your dens?
You have hands deft enough for something better
than “Bridge”—and eyes that can see how to make
shells for killing the enemy, which is better than
studying how to change a card that shall cheat a
friend! Put these ephemeral nothings of an ephemeral
“society” aside, and <span class="allsmcap">WORK</span>! Work is the saviour of
both body and soul!</p>

<p>I admit that as Women, we have long and old scores
to settle with the men who have denied us any place
in their counsels, and who elect of themselves to treat
us merely as “toys” and fools. We shall have our
revenge upon them, but not now. Now is the time
when we have the chance to show our ability, our
powers of organisation, our reasonableness, our courage,
our industry, and patience. Let us not fail! The
curse of the Jew who wrote Genesis and swore to Eve
“I will greatly multiply thy sorrow” has been upon
woman ever since the days when courteous old Abraham
yoked her with his cattle and drove her with his sheep;
but there are evidences nowadays that the modern Abraham
will not always triumph, even though every true
son of Israel who attends religious service in his
synagogue still says with Pecksniffian <span class="locked">fervour:—</span></p>

<p>“Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the
universe, who hast not made me a woman!” (See
Authorised Jewish Daily Prayer Book.)</p>

<p>But, despite this most manly thanksgiving, it is
paramount that now, whether Jew or Gentile, men
want the women!—not for pleasure, not for fooling,
not for seduction, not for betrayal, but for work!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>77</span>
Man’s work must be done in the absence of men. For
men must be set free, like uncaged wolves and lions,
to fly at the throat of the foe and strangle him for
good and all! Therefore, man’s work must be accomplished
by women. O women, be glad and proud
of this! Lady Frances Balfour, who has a brain
sufficing for three of our modern statesmen, has recently
written on “The Discovery of Women,” describing it
wittily as similar to “the discovery of America by
Christopher Columbus.” She reminds us of Lord
Lansdowne’s “early Victorian” pronouncement that
“the place for women is the home.” But the worthy
peer forgot to mention that it is not given to every
woman to have a home, or to run the cooking, the
child-bearing, and general washing-up business for
any special one of the male sex. On the other hand,
there are thousands of women who not only earn the
money to make a home and keep it, but who also have
the affectionate unwisdom to keep a lazy loafer of a
man also; some drone who finds as many plausible
excuses for idleness as he does for living on the woman’s
work. He, by the way, is generally the sort of fellow
who speaks of woman with sniggering contempt, and
while taking her earnings with the left hand stabs her
in the back with the right. But even such rogues as
these have to go forth to the battle to-day; so let us
not grudge the buckling on of their armour if we can
inspire courage in cowards! Just now, when omens
and portents are thick in the air, and unnatural
threatenings hover above us like shapeless spectres
of evil, our Ministers and statesmen are chattering
for all the world like the feeblest “patriarchs of the
village” that ever waggled grey pates over pipes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>78</span>
tobacco. They who complain of women’s “talk” are
talking the heads of the nation off into impatience
and fury; let women not talk, therefore, but act!
Come to work, women of all classes!—the more the
better!—the more silently, the more swiftly! There
is a great climax at hand; the “push” is about to begin.
<span class="smcap">Every Able-Bodied Man Is Needed to Ensure
Victory.</span> Let us make no mistake about that! Every
woman is likewise needed, to put her hand to the
plough, and <span class="allsmcap">NOT</span> look back. Munitions must not fail
us. Show your resolve, brave women of England,
Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, and nerve your slender
hands to the task of turning out the weapons of attack
and defence that shall flame our conquest of the foe
on land and sea and in the air! And—when the war
is over—when “Peace with Honour” shines once more
above us like a glorious rainbow after storm—shall
we—we Women who have worked, sink to our old
footing of debasement and exclusion from the counsels
of men? No! To paraphrase a famous Asquith
utterance: “We have taken our place, and we shall
continue to take it, and to keep it!”</p>

<span class="subhead">AN APPEAL TO AMERICA FOR SUFFERERS IN THE
GREAT WAR

<span class="subhead">(<i>Written by special request for the American “Committee of
Mercy”</i>)</span></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">There</span> is no greater virtue in the human character
than mercy; it is the nearest attribute and approach
to the Divine Perfection towards Whom all creation
instinctively moves. We, the offspring of that infinite
Thought and Will, are still far away from such sweet
and strong attainment of power as can find infinitude
of joy in the infinitude of Giving—but we can in some
measure bless and purify our brief poor lives with somewhat
of that everlasting plenitude and beauty by an
effort, no matter how feeble, towards a God-like
perpetuity of grace and pity. The golden opportunity
for that effort is Now and Here; we may never have
so great a chance again. For Now and Here, in the
fair days of spring and summer, when singing, blossoming
Nature breaks out in its Te Deum of thankfulness
for yet another space of time wherein to express the
gladness and glory of life, we are confronted with the
hideous, ravaging spectacle of War; War, in its most
cruel, pitiless, and appalling shape—War, to the
grimmest death! The groans and shrieks of wounded,
tortured, and dying men are forced upon our ears; a
monstrous Devil of Self, black with the crimes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>80</span>
treachery, lust, and murder, stalks abroad seeking what
it may devour of faith, freedom, and civilisation—a
demon possibly born of mankind’s own neglect of
the highest ideals, and indifference to countless
blessings long bestowed.</p>

<p>And the most evil part of this evil visitation is that
the terrific whirlwind of disaster sweeps over the
innocent as well as the guilty, and men of valour and
worth in all the nations now at war with one another
are driven by the force of a barbarous necessity into
the agony of wounds and death for no fault of their
own, but for the mistakes and aggressions of their
governmental rulers. They are as falling leaves blown
before a storm—as smoke before fire—drifting into
darkness! Yet every one of them is moved by the
inspiration and love of liberty—by the sense of right
and justice—and by the desire to help in doing what
is good and true for the larger benefit of the whole
world. And in this sense every one of them is noble;
each life is worth our grateful care. We, who appeal
for them, take no part in the contest. To us they are
all our brothers in humanity; <em>their</em> mothers, wives,
sisters, children, and lovers are ours also! We wish
to lift them in our helping arms out of the blood and
mire of battle, and by our impartial love and tenderness,
to comfort them as much as we may, and relieve
their bitter need.</p>

<p>We want every American citizen to help us in this
great, this divine, work; for so best shall we prove the
largeness of our thought, and the wideness and scope
of the civilisation of the Republic and it ideals; so
shall we best display the spirit of the young New
World, uprising on the waters of this deluge like an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>81</span>other
ark of the covenant, sending forth the dove of hope
and promise to those who are struggling for life in the
overwhelming waves. We would like to write the
noble words of Man’s universal Poet, Shakespeare,
across the doors of all our fellow-countrymen upon
whom we now call for aid, convinced of their generous
<span class="locked">response:—</span></p>

<p>In this mind and mood we appeal for help: for
ungrudging, tenderest, quickest help!—the help that
brave persons would instantly give if they saw children
drowning. For every man disabled, sick, or deprived
of his strength is as a struggling child in the flood of
adversity, and indeed more pitiful than a child, for
the child’s day may be yet to come, while his is past.
Moreover, he has been snatched from all that made
life pleasant and useful to himself, to fight his country’s
battle, for which he, personally, is not responsible,
but which he enters upon for the sake of a duty which
is purely heroic self-sacrifice. Let us therefore accept
this free gift of his manhood in the cause of Right and
Justice and Freedom, with no less cheerful and willing
gifts and self-sacrifices of our own; let us give and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>82</span>
still give, in the all-beneficent spirit of the daily sunlight
which pours itself out unasked over the fields
and pastures to bless and fructify them! And let us
never weary of giving! From every man and woman
of the teeming population of the United States we
ask a donation for our Holy Cause—our new Crusade
of the Lord’s Sepulchre—for such it is, inasmuch as
we seek to raise from the grave of silence and despair
those who have been giving the best of their lives in
suffering the horrors of this terrific War. Be the gift
small or great it will add to the sum of what we hope
to make the most wonderful and munificent gift and
act of homage to martyred heroes that has ever been
known in the world! We are a Committee of Mercy,
and we make this Appeal to all the merciful, in God’s
Name, and for the sweet uplifting of a Star of Hope
in the darkness!</p>

<p>“<em>Six million of people are on the verge of starvation
in Belgium!</em>”</p>

<p>Such news as this writes itself across the brain in
letters of fire! Great Goddess of Liberty, think of
it! You, America!—you, who represent that goddess,
with the light of an ever-widening glory on her brow,
think of this shame to the very name of Freedom!—this
blot on civilisation—this degrading result, as it
were, of our long-boasted intellectual supremacy and
scientific advancement! <em>Six million people on the
verge of starvation!</em>—through no fault of their own,
an industrious, peaceful, marvellously heroic little
nation, deprived of its honestly-earned right to live,
and dragged from its altars of prayer to weep in the
dust of beggary and famine! You, America!—you,
Star-crowned States of Freedom that have already
done so much and <em>are</em> doing so much for this broken
and bleeding victim of bitter circumstance—you
cannot stay your hand now!—you cannot—you will
not! You will do <em>more</em>!—and still <em>more</em>! You cannot
see a brave nation die of sheer hunger!—it is not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>84</span>
in your heart to look on at such a frightful thing
unmoved; therefore you will listen to all unprejudiced
appeal—even to mine, though I have little claim
to your hearing save that of the affection freely
given to me by thousands of my readers in your
country—an affection gratefully accepted and as
warmly reciprocated! I have naught to do with
the quarrels and murderous onslaughts of men filled
with blind fury and lust of world-power; all that I
can see or hear is the sorrow and suffering befalling
those who are innocent of any quarrel—the wives,
the mothers, the young girls and boys, the little children—the
helpless and bewildered old people! Cruel
famine is already torturing these piteous and patiently
enduring souls, on whom such a black cloud of unmerited
disaster has fallen that it seems as if it would
never lift! All who have power to visualise their
unparalleled distress <em>must</em> and surely <em>will</em> take every
possible means to soften and mitigate the horrors of
their situation. Generous America!—you have done
and are doing much!—you have worked and are
working strenuously to relieve the burden of Belgium’s
heavy affliction, but work to you is the very pulse of
your large life, and bigness of conception in noble
deeds is your breathing power! Therefore, no hesitation
need be felt in asking you to go on <em>Working</em>
and <em>Doing</em> all you can for the tortured, half dying
people of a devastated country—a people whose
magnificent heroism has blazoned itself in a chronicle
of glory for the wonder of the future years—a nation
that has faced her foes unflinchingly in the simple
defence of her freedom, and whose noble King, a hero
to the manner born, has not uttered one undignified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>85</span>
word of complaint against the sudden and harsh
calamities meted out to him by the cruel caprices
of a cruel destiny. To America all grand things
are possible—America, as yet aloof from combat, can
accomplish what other nations, involved in difficulties
at this juncture, can barely attempt: America can
approach Germany with the ease of one at peace
in the midst of strife, and can with humane forethought
and certainty secure such distribution of
food supplies to the Belgian civil population as
may save them from the sufferings which now confront
them every day. This is what America can
do and with all our hearts and souls we pray that it
may be quickly done! <em>We</em>, in Great Britain, are
never weary of helping, to the best of our ability,
those exiles who have lost their homes and means of
livelihood—we strive to make their hard lot less bitter—and
to one and all we accord a welcome as to those
of our own blood and kindred. But we are at war,
and though our Government is using all the means
available to prevent the threatening disaster of millions
of non-combatants, women, children, and the aged,
being sacrificed to what is called “military necessity,”
such means are not enough, being perforce obstructed
by the difficulties of the situation. The grim idol of
Militarism must have its burnt offerings—that pitiless
god of Battle so aptly and magnificently described
in Lord Byron’s <span class="locked"><cite>Childe Harold</cite>:—</span></p>

<p>Time presses! The wolf of famine is at the very
doors! Our hearts grow cold with terror and with
pity as we see once prosperous and happy Belgium,
a land of prosperous and happy people, shadowed by
the fearful spectres of Hunger and Disease. And
while we do all we can and all we may to keep back
these menacing destroyers of the innocent, we clasp
hands across the sea with America, and look to her
reasonableness, her boundless compassion and benevolence,
for wider, more continuous help, feeling
that she can, and will, most assuredly move the
German administration in Belgium to see to the
free distribution of food, and to guarantee that
such distribution shall be made for the benefit of
the Belgian civil population. I believe the Germans
would willingly consent to this, if they have not
already consented, for it cannot be even to their own
advantage that disease should be sown broadcast in
Belgium, and the entire industrial population decimated
by famine. Indeed, as a matter of fact, Mr. Whitlock,
the American Minister at Brussels, has made definite
and official statement to the effect that he is satisfied
by close investigation on the spot that not an ounce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>87</span>
of food sent in by the Commission for Relief is being
appropriated by the Germans. It should, perhaps,
be considered that Germany has a heart somewhere!
There are natural emotions in the mortal composition
of a German as well as in a Frenchman or a Briton—differently
strung, no doubt, and differently placed—but
no man of any nationality whatsoever is made
solely of “blood and iron,” according to that hackneyed
catch-penny phrase which seems to have been coined
by some tall-talking journalist. I am not one of the
many who “thrill” over the various and sensational
reports gotten up by the world’s press, whether such
reports emanate from Great Britain or the “Wolff
Bureau.” I am as doubtful of statements circulated
by British journalism as of those which are unblushingly
“made in Germany.” Each newspaper proprietor
has his own axe to grind, and not always does honesty
or unsullied patriotism have much to do with the
grinding. More mischief than can be easily calculated
is caused by irresponsible journalists who are allowed
to print their wholly useless and unnecessary personal
opinions on some great world-crisis in leading newspapers.
When Edward the Seventh ascended the British
Throne he had something to say on one occasion
to “the gentlemen of the Press,” and he expressed
the hope that they would “do their best to foster amity
and good-will between the British Empire and other
nations.” That the “gentlemen” have not so acquitted
themselves is a sad and sober fact; and in these
very days of the most terrific contest the world has
ever seen, many of them show an unworthy eagerness
to “work up” suspicion and ill-feeling between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>88</span>
combating parties, rather than to hold the balance
equably and with dignity. Insult, cheap sneers, and
vulgar jesting are all out of place in the present tremendous
clash of conflicting powers; when the gods
grasp their thunderbolts it is no time to listen to the
chattering of apes. And when we are told by the
Irresponsible Journalist of more battle horrors and
outrages than seem humanly possible of occurrence,
it does us good to learn through plain, unvarnished
fact conveyed in simply-written, straightforward letters
from brave men at the front and in the “firing
line,” that, left to themselves, the Germans and their
Allied foes would be glad enough to play football
together, if allowed, like healthy schoolboys, and that
even as it is they give each other cigarettes across the
trenches, proof positive that when not acting “under
orders,” they are human, normal, and friendly, and
have no thirst for each other’s blood. I quote the
following from the letter of a brave young Englishman
serving in the Third Battalion of the Rifle <span class="locked">Brigade:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On Christmas morning some of us went out in front
of the German trenches and shook hands with them,
and they gave us cigars, cigarettes, and money as
souvenirs. We helped them to bury their dead, who
had been lying in the fields for two months. It was a
strange sight to see English and German soldiers as
well as officers shaking hands and chatting together.
We asked them to play us at football, but they had no
time. I got into conversation with one who worked
at Selfridge’s in London, and he said he was very
sorry to have to fight against us.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>89</span></p>

<p>Reading this and various other letters of similar
tone from men in the very thick of battle, all bearing
ample testimony to the same truth, I cannot believe
that the foe is so utterly a monster as to wish to see
six million innocent people slowly starved to death;
for such a dire business would serve his purpose little,
while strongly intensifying his immediate unpopularity.
War is war; and if, after all, civilisation is so poorly
advanced that war must still play its barbarous part
in the world’s policy, then of course there must be
exigencies of war which can neither be ameliorated
nor minimised. But the deliberate starvation of six
million innocent human beings, more or less useful to
their kind, does not and cannot come under the head
of “military necessity.” Therefore, it should be the
proud privilege and duty of “neutrals” to do all that
is possible to soften and mitigate the fearful conditions
of life as at present lived in unhappy but undaunted
Belgium. The Commission for Relief, acting in London,
and comprising representatives of the Spanish,
Dutch, and Italian Embassies as well as the American,
has undertaken a task which is almost herculean. Work
as they will—and there is no pause and no shirking—it
is like coping with the waves of an engulfing sea.
The needs of the people become more urgent every
day that the fierce tug-of-war grows closer and more
insistent: Great Britain has found it imperative to
stop the importation of grain into Belgium, and all
this is coupled with the fact that under the Hague
convention the German army has the right to requisition
food supplies, and is not bound (save morally)
to feed the enemy’s population. Nevertheless,
common sense and diplomacy, as well as mercy and jus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>90</span>tice,
may here step in and show that starvation and
sickness may breed evil among the Germans themselves
as well as among the Belgians, by sheer force of contagion—evil
of a kind which might just as conveniently
be avoided. Any starving nation claims instant help
and compassion—the sufferings it is compelled to undergo
are too awful to contemplate with any degree
of calmness, and may make even the sternest “Teuton”
shudder. Therefore, if any of us can, or dare, call
ourselves Christians in the face of this un-Christian
warfare, which neither religion, science, nor “New
Thought,” spiritual or intellectual, has been deep or
sincere enough to hinder, let us gather up the fragile
fragments of our faith and try to piece them together
in one heart-whole, soul-strong effort to save from
impending misery the brave little nation, rich in historical
splendour of renown, artistic beauty, and industrial
progress, whose hard-working people have desired
nothing but peace and freedom to attend to their
own business unmolested. If Christianity is worth
anything in the world we would not let <em>one</em> starving
creature go unfed from our doors—shall we leave
six million to such an undeserved fate? If we do,
then well may the great Powers Invisible chastise us
to our own doom, and vengeful Furies whip us to a
hell of shame and oblivion! Let us hold out rescue at
once with no uncertain hands, and let our practical
aid be swift, and “of good measure, pressed down and
running over.” In all such deeds of love and sympathy
and charity Great Britain and America have led the
world by their splendid example. There has been
no grudging, no paltry personal discussion as to ways
and means. For every good and worthy cause gold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>91</span>
pours out as from a magical horn of plenty; the more
the demand, the greater the supply. And now? Now—when
a nation starves! Shall not a veritable argosy
of gold make its way across the miles of ocean which
divide the Fortunate from the Unhappy, and bridge
the gulf of tears and sorrow, striking light from darkness,
and hope from despair? This can be so if America
wills it! Shall not a radiant Angel of Consolation
appear within the deepest gloom of battle, stretching
out hands of blessings and sustenance, lifting the fallen,
cheering the desolate, soothing the dying, and shedding
heavenly sunshine on a sorrow-clouded land?
This can be so if America wills it! Shall not the
true brotherhood of humanity be re-affirmed and
strengthened in the rescue of one nation by another?—in
the succour of the smaller by the greater?—in
the full acknowledgment of a brave fight for freedom
by a power that is more than free? This can be so
if America wills it!</p>

<p>“O Liberty! what crimes are committed in thy
name!” were the last words of Madame Roland, heroic
victim of the French Revolution—but we would say:
“O Liberty! what love is perfected in thy name!”
when starving Belgium is fed!—because America wills
it! Hear my appeal, O Star-crowned States of Freedom!—hear
me!—hear all!—Let no pleading voice
pass you by <em>un</em>-heard! For the brave Nation that is
dying must live!—<em>shall</em> live!—if America wills it!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_12">“THE TIME OF OUR LIVES”<br />

<span class="subhead">OUR WOMEN IN WAR

<span class="subhead">(<i>An answer to an American misjudgment</i>)</span></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">“You</span> women over here seem to be having the time of
your lives!” said an American friend to me the other
day. “You lunch and dine at all the restaurants with
whatever men ‘on leave’ you can pick up; you go
with them to music-halls and theatres and supper
dances, and ‘peacock’ about in extravagant clothes as
if there were no such thing as a war on!”</p>

<p>My American friend, being a man, took, as is often
the case with men, rather a one-sided view of things;
but what he said is true, and I fully endorse his
statement. I am proud and eager to assure our American
sisters “on the other side,” that most surely we <em>are</em>
having “the time of our lives”! No doubt about it!
But, do you understand, you women of New York,
Boston, Chicago, and every other great and growing
city in the United States, what that “time” exactly is?
Are you able to measure it and give it your true understanding?
I think not! It is easy to sit as spectators
in your vast amphitheatre of across ocean and watch
from comfortably-cushioned points of view the struggle
in the world’s arena between Men and Beasts; the contest
is terrific, revolting, yet sensational—and provides
“thrills” for those who are not actively engaged
in combat. But for women whose husbands, lovers, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>93</span>
sons are being mauled and crushed and torn by the
teeth and claws of ravening and unreasoning brutes,
it is a spectacle demanding “nerve,” to say the least
of it. This “nerve”—this power of valiant endurance
is what Great Britain’s women are displaying in “the
time of their lives”—the time of loss and sorrow,
danger and difficulty; and I doubt whether the true
history of this indomitable pluck, cheerfulness, patience,
and resignation will ever be rightly known!
They have been, and still are—magnificent!—a glory
and an honour to their sex! “The time of their lives”
will be recorded in the country’s annals as among the
most sublime things witnessed and proved in a century.
They have grudged no sacrifice, no pain; they have
sent their best and dearest to the great slaughterhouse
of Flanders with smiles on their lips, restraining
the sobs of agony in their hearts—they have not shrunk
in one single instance from any clear duty, however
difficult or apart from their own ways of life. Where
men’s places have needed to be filled, they have filled
them most ably, conscientiously, and loyally, without
grumbling or complaint; and though some of their
male employers, too old to fight, but never too old to
“bully,” have occasionally made things uncomfortable
for them by coarse words and coarser actions, they
have held their peace for the sake of their men at the
front, and are content to bear with insolence and
insult in silence rather than interrupt the routine of
the work they have undertaken in order to “release”
the men, such “release” often meaning for themselves
sheer heart-break and desolation. Oh, yes!—we are
having “the time of our lives”!—a time such as this
world never saw, and which we all pray it may never see<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>94</span>
again!—a time when wives toil in munition works to
“release” their husbands, knowing that such “release”
may mean their own widowhood—when mothers part
bravely from their sons, conscious that they are going
into such a hell of barbarous slaughter as never was
known even in the days of the Roman butcher, Nero—when
girls “release” their lovers, and bend their
own slight bodies to the heavy toil usually undertaken
by the physically stronger sex, and say nothing of their
own fatigue, suspense, and sorrow! There are thousands
of such splendid women to set against the few
hundreds who “dine at restaurants” and “peacock
about,” and even these latter are not so abandoned
to self and vainglory as they seem. True, there are
women who push their own ends under cover of professing
charity, and are never so happy as when they
see their own portraits in the lower grade press—this
class has always existed in every country and will
no doubt continue to exist. And there are plenty of
female “decoys” for men “on leave”—who dine and
dance at public restaurants in <em>un</em>-dress that would disgrace
a savage; but, again, these have always existed,
and will probably continue to exist. The good Bishop
of London seems to have only just discovered them,
which is a great testimony to his guilelessness. Then
there is a particularly unfortunate section of the pictorial
press which seeks to attract the public eye by
indecent pictures of half-nude “women of the town”—dancers,
actresses, and titled dames who are equally
at one in a voluntary outrage of morals and modesty,
and though the public Censor might very well put a
stop to these offensive illustrations, he is apparently
one of those “blind who will not see.” But you, our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>95</span>
sisters in America, do see, and rashly pass judgment
accordingly! Then there are the ridiculous fashion-plates
used as advertisements in newspapers and in
the catalogues of leading drapers, which represent
women as the merest caricaturess of womanhood, looking
more like cockatoos and chimpanzees than feminine
humanity, in costumes presented as “the fashion,” but
which no decent woman ever dreams of wearing. All
this is “the scum of the pot” which rises to the top,
thereby becoming noticeable—but it does not represent
the actual Womanhood of Britain—the great, Silent
Force of patient, brave, unwearying workers. These
are scarcely heard of, for they give no chance to the
tongues of Rumour, and the press cannot get at them
either for portraits or personalities. As noble and
exclusive as that noble and exclusive lady, the Duchess
of Portland, whose good works are legion, they make
no clamour—they are too busy to contend with the
already opposing masculine spirit which is beginning to
demand of them, “Are you going to <em>dare</em> do our work
after the war?” The main fact with them is not the
Afterwards but the <em>Now</em>—the resolve to hold together
the working necessities of Commerce and Agriculture
in Britain—Now!—in time of need—thinking nothing
of themselves or of the pleasant little vanities and
frivolities dear to them in days of peace, but bracing up
all their energies to oppose trouble with valour, patience,
and faith. No women in all the world’s history
have ever risen to confront a world’s crisis so
splendidly and cheerfully as the British—except the
French! French women are superb in their magnificent
patriotism!—superb in their steadfast hate of the
foe. We are often told that the British do not “hate”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>96</span>
enough—and that if we were better haters we should
be better lovers. It may be so, but the general tendency
among us is more to despise than to hate. A “Tommy,”
for example, would hardly think it worth while to
“hate” anybody. Good-nature is the Briton’s strong
point; good-nature and a cool, easy, “happy-go-lucky”
disposition. These virtues or failings led him into the
German traps whereby he was losing his hold on the
commerce of the world. He could not be brought to
believe that his progressing friend “Fritz” could stab
him in the back while he stood unarmed and unready
for attack; and, even now, when he is up and full
face to the combat, his good-nature still moves him
to sing and whistle along the fire-swept path to death
or glory, and to stop, regardless of self, among a hail
of bullets to give first or last aid to a dying foeman.
Is such conduct foolish or sublime? A higher verdict
than ours must give answer! In any case we know
and may take it for certain that the “Silent Force” of
women who are “having the time of their lives” is a
great lever to lift the men up to the utmost pitch of
their native-born courage and resolution, and to help
them meet Death as a fellow-soldier, taking the hand of
the grisly skeleton as fearlessly as children might run
to look at some attractive novelty. For, back of us all,
men and women alike, there is a strong Faith which our
enemies have lost. <em>They</em> talk of “Unser Gott” as glibly
as though the Almighty were solely exercised in serving
their whims and passions—but though <em>our</em> deepest
religion be not of the Churches, we cannot so trifle
with the Holy Name! We are too conscious of “The
Truth that makes us free,” and in the Cause for which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>97</span>
we and our Allies are fighting, we can best pray with
Shakespeare’s Harry the Fifth:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“O God of Battles! Steel my soldiers’ hearts!</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Possess them not with fear; take from them now</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">The sense of numbers!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For our Cause is the Cause of Right and Justice,
Freedom and Civilisation. We are not out for personal
gain, either in gold or territory. We have enough of
both and to spare. We endure “the time of our lives,”
and its wanton and wicked slaughter of the innocent,
because we are fighting for all Humanity that it may
never be so savagely tortured again. We are fighting
for a surer, more impregnable Civilisation—one that
cannot be pushed back a thousand years by the ferocious
and blind stupidity of any temporary autocrat. Is it
possible that there can be people of even average intelligence
in the States and elsewhere that do not entirely
understand this? The British intervention in the dastardly
attack of Germany on Belgium and France
was to protect and defend unoffending and peaceable
peoples, and in this defence of others we have found
Ourselves. We were beginning to lose ourselves among
the dreary verbosities of theorists and agnostics and
atheists and all the swarm of destructive insects which
accompany a setting-in of decadence; we have discovered
once again our true spirit, our old and valiant
mettle, our pride and love of country, and all the
mighty heart of resolution which has made the British
Empire what it is. And we cannot but feel that the
young and strong heart of America beats in tune with
our own—that, despite financial interests and pro-Ger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>98</span>man
intrigues, Right and Justice prevail with the men
and women of the United States as with the men and
women of this “little isle set in a silver sea”—and that
they very well know that they, too, must benefit by the
clearance from the world of a monstrous Militarism
whose ethics are opposed to every principle of Christian
truth and human equity. A great, strong Faith is
at the back of us all—a Faith which believes in the utmost
triumph of Good over Evil—and this it is which
inspires the women of Great Britain and gives them
strength to part with their nearest and dearest, so
that they endure “the time of their lives” without flinching,
knowing that they who endure to the end shall be
saved!</p>

</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">What</span> is the most urgent need of the world? What
would stop war and ensure peace? What would push
forward all that is highest and best in our civilisation,
and cause men and women to realise that they are
not created to brutalise, degrade, and destroy each
other in sordid struggles for place and power, but that
their purpose in living at all is to educate and uplift
each other to noble aims and ends? The great Need
stares us in the face at every point of social law and
political government; it clamours in our ears and
pushes its problem to the front of every question.
What is it the world demands in every form of policy,
legislation, and statesmanship? A simple thing—one
would imagine it to be a natural thing—yet almost undiscoverable
in any period of history—Sanity! Sanity,
which means health of both brain and body; Sanity
which recognises self only as a portion of the greater
Whole; Sanity which knows instinctively that mankind
must obey the laws of God or else suffer extinction;
Sanity, which combines with reason and judgment a
comprehensive sympathy for every unit of the human
race in its struggle upward from the brute period to
the highest realisation of intellectual and spiritual
worth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>100</span></p>

<p>Judged from this point of view one may doubt,
when reading history from its known or traditional
beginnings, whether Man, taken in bulk, has ever been
entirely sane. Something of the freak, the monster,
or the only half human, seems to taint his blood,
displaying itself in follies and excesses of the most
violent or pitiful nature, which, when dispassionately
narrated in the chronicles of centuries, show him to
be a crank or a fool at the very time when wisdom
might most be expected of him. Some few individuals,
notable examples to the race, have stood out in splendid
isolation as sane and self-sacrificing teachers and helpers
of humanity; but, in the aggregate, from the very
beginnings of what we are pleased to call “progress”
down to the present day, the desire to trample upon
each other and wallow in blood and slaughter seems
to prevail with more force over the minds of men than
the clearest arguments of reason. Nevertheless this
desire is an insane impulse, and if we had any true
perception of the laws of right and wrong, we should
check it in its very first beginnings. Any man, any
body of men, seeking to violate the peace and progress
of the world should be dealt with by combined international
forces of the Law and Medicine, not by armies—and
should either be shot like mad dogs as incurable
and dangerous, or imprisoned for life in asylums for the
criminally insane. No one man or group of men can
be considered in sound mental condition if their actions
imperil the existence of their fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Certain natural laws have been discovered, and
proved by physiologists who make the subject their
study, as to persons who may marry, and those for
whom, through consanguinity or inherited disease, mar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>101</span>riage
is nothing less than a crime. In the “arranged”
unions of royal houses these laws have been deliberately
set aside with deplorable results. The mad dog of
Europe, William of Hohenzollern, is the diseased product
of several royal intermarriages, where human convenience
and popular complaisance ignored the divine
natural law; and as this law is one which prevails
“unto the third and fourth generation” we have now a
Monster-Abortion of conscienceless cruelty raging loose
in the world, who ought to have been smothered in his
cradle. There are plain rules of health and sanity
which are for ever being disobeyed by civil and social
convention; but because they are so disobeyed, we
must not flatter ourselves that they do not recoil in
vengeance upon the rebels. The Designer of this wonderful
and complex universe is proved to be a vastly
Mathematical Intelligence; everything great or small,
down to a grain of dust, is balanced to the nicety of a
hair’s breadth, and do what we will or may, we cannot
alter the balance. Our futile efforts in such directions
merely display insanity, of the type of an uncontrolled
temper in a child which screams itself hoarse because
it cannot reach fruit on a tree too high for it to climb.
If, therefore, we would have sane peoples, with sane
rulers to govern them, we should see to it that they
are born and bred sanely, according to the laws of
health and mentality which have existed among the
“lower” animal creation since the foundation of the
world. Every crime is an insane impulse. No healthily
organised brain could contemplate the murder of a
single individual, much less the wholesale slaughter of
millions.</p>

<p>The Almighty has for ever had one gate of Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>102</span>
set ajar for humanity to peer within and push open
a little wider with each succeeding generation—a gate
opening to that fair pleasaunce of wisdom and beauty
which we call Science. A great logician has written
“The basis of all science is the immutability of the
laws of nature.” Would that we remembered that “immutability”
more often! Yet, while sane pioneers in
medicine and surgery are patiently and devoutly following
as best they can these complex but beneficent
“laws of nature” for the saving of human life and the
healing of human injuries, the <em>in</em>sane section of the
community have been and are still employing all their
distorted energies of brain and hand in fiendish ingenuities
of invention for weapons of war that shall
destroy human life more quickly than it can be saved.
And while thus engaged, other insane persons shout
in the press and the market place wild warnings about
“declining birth-rate,” reproaching unhappy women for
their lack of duty in not producing sons for some future
slaughter! The Car of Juggernaut was scarcely
worse than this! To appeal for a multitude of births
during the making of a multitude of guns, which mow
down the flower of young manhood like corn, is an
insult to bereaved mothers, making their vocation appear
less valuable than that of the beasts of the field.
For why should they bring forth and rear sons, only
that they may go to their deaths at the bidding of
this or that Government? The very proposition is an
exhibition of stark staring lunacy, combined with a
brutish lust of degradation and reckless destructiveness
which could only emanate from deficient mental organisms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>103</span></p>

<h3>SANITY IN RELIGION</h3>

<p>Here we touch the vital centre of the whole. On
no subject does man ever show himself so violently
crazed as on religion. The gods of the past, created
by his fanatical imagination, were more or less the
deified types of his own vices, or symbols of such
virtues as he feebly strove to attain, but he had no
real faith in their power to aid or to circumvent his
designs. Yet, in lunatic fashion, he behaved as if he
thought them omnipotent, though conscious all the
while of the silly comedy he was playing with himself.
Now, after two thousand years of the pure and beautiful
Gospel of Christ which teaches how “god-in-man”
might be realised, a lesson to which has been added
the strong affirmation of Science, emphasising the fact
that “God is a Spirit, and they that worship Him
must worship Him in spirit and in truth,” Man still
plays the crazed crank with dogma, and refuses to
realise the Actual Alive Intelligence behind creation,
which, from the delicate fluff of a small bird’s feather
or moth’s wing, up to the height of solar systems,
works in perfection and balance to the exactitude of
a pin’s point. This living, loving Presence the dogmatists
wellnigh ignore, preferring to move in their own
small orbit of creed rather than risk the broader spaces
of assured glory. The narrow spirit of self-absorption
not only limits their outlook, but holds them bound
in a condition of deplorable egotism, like that of an
“unco guid” Scotch body who, after accepting many
useful kindnesses from a friend to whom she “gushed”
affection, changed her sentiments as soon as a slight
difference arose between them, and with much unctuous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>104</span>
piety let it be known that she was obliged to leave
that once “precious” friend’s name “out of her prayers”!
The monstrous conceit that could imagine God
capable of noticing a name left out of a Scotchwoman’s
prayers, or out of any prayers whatsoever, would be
ludicrous if it were not so pitifully expressive of barbaric
ignorance—and who shall count the thousands of
similar narrow mind and heart who have a lurking
hope that heaven is for them alone, and that their
“dear friends” will all be left out in the cold!</p>

<p>Sanity in religion would mean sanity in everything.
A sane acceptance of the actual Motive Force of things,—a
Force, tenderly embodied to us by Christ’s teaching
as the “Our Father” of us all, would do more for
our souls and bodies than all the Churches; an intelligent
study and comprehension of the minute and careful
work of creation, showing us that nothing is wasted,
nothing lost—but that all tends in an onward direction
to “some far-off divine event,” would help us to find
and keep the balance of our brains. We must be
brought to realise that Evil, persisted in, works its
own recoil on the evil doers, whether they be nations
or individuals—the movement of things being always
towards Good. “I and my Father are one”—said Our
Lord, for which He was stoned. The failure of the
Churches is the insanity of dogma, which has supplanted
the sanity of Christ.</p>

<h3>BRAIN BALANCE</h3>

<p>The brain, as all physiologists know, is a complex
and marvellous mechanism—so amazing in its movements,
so miraculous in the result of these movements,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>105</span>
that no scientist has yet been able entirely to probe
its powers or foresee its progressive possibilities. Some
there are who declare that all impulses, good and
evil, are primarily started by the brain—others, more
subtly accurate, aver that the brain itself is impelled
or “pushed” to action by an influence stronger than
itself, mysterious, unnameable, but nevertheless all-potent,
which we call “free-will,” but which may more
justly be termed “free-spirit”; that is to say the “free”
and deathless force which the Creator gives to each
human being to use according to the laws He has
ordained, but which, turned aside from these, can
be debased as surely as exalted. This untrammelled
power is bestowed on every man and woman born
into the world, and its mode of action is frequently
swayed by impressions, sometimes pre-natal, and sometimes
by the “afterwards” of early surroundings. If
the material brain of a child is sound and healthy,
the impulses which move that brain should be sane
and pure—but, unhappily, through the physical mentality
of irresponsible persons who recklessly take the
divine responsibility of parenthood upon themselves,
it often chances that a brain, perfectly organised in
the matter and placement of its cells, conceives ideas
and actions which are little short of devilish in their
ingenuity of evil and mastership of cunning. How
is this? It is not the forty pairs of nerves which convey
sense and feeling to the brain that are guilty of
criminal suggestion—they are merely the telegraph
wires on which messages are sent. But Who is the
sender? Who or what is responsible for the messages
which prompt wicked deeds? We feel that we do not
have to inquire as to the source of Good, inasmuch as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>106</span>
that Divine Manifestation is everywhere about us. One
thing, however, is certain—that evil propensities corrupt
and obstruct the blood-vessels of the brain and
distort its images and impressions, so that its powers
become perverted—and instead of creating helpful work
for the welfare of humanity it dwells on what shall
harm and terrorise and destroy. But we must and
should realise the fact that an obstructed brain is a
more or less <em>insane</em> brain. Its channels do not run
clear. From these blocked passages inhuman thoughts
are generated as weeds from slime; and fiendish or
vicious ideas take shape and action like noxious vermin
bred from a stagnant pool. Therefore, if we
would have regard to sanity in the race, it should be
our business to see to the “Brain-Balance” of our social,
ethical, political, and religious conditions, and
eliminate from our lives such things as tend towards
incipient lunacy. “Crazes” for this or that particular
person or fashion are painfully common, and always
ludicrous, accompanied as they frequently are by a
didactic obstinacy resembling the pompous assertiveness
of poor madmen who conceive themselves to be
exiled kings. Men and women run about jabbering
and gesticulating on the “preciousness” of this or that
form of art, when it is utterly opposed to truth and
nature, and in this sort of spirit they have held up
the “Futurists” and “Cubists” as something worthy
to be looked at, much as a child might hold up for
admiration a dirty rag doll. Insane themselves, they
seek to lead others into the chaos of their own insanity,
and this trend towards a warped mentality has of late
displayed itself in all the arts, such as the sculpture
of Epstein, the crotchets and quavers of De Bussy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>107</span>
and the large output of revoltingly sexual fiction and
coarse verse. The “pose” of a supreme and scornful
egotism marks these devotees of sham and ineptitude,
and though they may, in mere numbers, be a negligible
quantity, they spread infection, just as one fever-stricken
person may infect a whole neighbourhood.
From an unsanitary mental outlook no good can come,
and the moral filth in which Germany has wallowed
for years has so poisoned the German brain that it
can devise nothing but treachery and evil. It is a
brain that is choked with miasma—and it may be
centuries before it is cleansed and restored to sanity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile let us pull the beam out of our own eye
before we try to cure other nations’ blindnesses. We
have been mad enough in our disregard of honest
warnings—we are pretty mad still. We have vied with
the old-time “cities of the plain” in reckless orgies of
vice and intemperance; but the great War has pulled us
back on the road to ruin, and it seems we may be
given another chance. Let us begin then by a good
try for Sanity. In the first place let us make such
laws for those who marry as shall compel them to
submit to a searching health examination, so that union
may be forbidden to the unfit. A diseased man or
woman should no more be allowed to mate than any
other diseased animal. The animals arrange this themselves,
in a much more common-sense way than humans.
They only rear healthy progeny. It is for us
to do the same, and to see to it that the <em>mentality</em> of
children is safeguarded and set on a sound basis. This
cannot be done by forcing education at too early an
age, or perplexing young brains with difficulties of
learning almost too much for their elders to grasp. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>108</span>
brain in childhood records impressions as a disc prepared
for the phonograph records sound, and the circles
marked on it in early days are seldom or never effaced.
Therefore care must and should be taken that
such impressions are of the best. Corporal punishment
should never be resorted to as a means of training.
A blow to a sensitive child frequently means a lasting
contempt for the parent or teacher who inflicts it, and
excites a rebellious spirit towards life in general. A
vicious impulse or an act of crass stupidity does not
necessarily mean inherent wickedness or obstinacy—it
only shows that there is some “clog on the wheel” in
the brain, which a day’s fasting and cooling medicine
may remove. At any rate, such a method of cure is
better worth trying than the rod and angry threats
which have no real effect on “insane impulse.” Sometimes—indeed
often—a physical defect in the brain
is the cause of evil thoughts and evil deeds, as in the
recent case of a man whose warped mind always tended
towards murder and mutilation, and who was found
to have a thickening of a portion of the cranium which
pressed heavily upon certain of the cells within. The
operation of “trepanning” was performed by a surgeon
who was scientifically interested in the case, with the
result that the previously insane criminal is now a
person of perfectly normal type and harmless disposition.
Who that knows the history of the German
Kaiser’s ancestry can doubt that his brain has been
more or less diseased from his birth, and that with
his approach towards the “grand climacteric” the incipient
lunacy bred within him has become more active
and less capable of control! No <em>sane</em> man would
have acted as he has done, for, prior to the war, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>109</span>
trade of Europe was practically in Germany’s hands,
and in the interests of his country a sane man would
have realised the fulness and value of such a conquest,
peacefully obtained without the sacrifice of millions of
useful lives.</p>

<h3>THE IMPORTANCE OF CHARACTER</h3>

<p>The brain is affected by “insane impulse” in the
same way as the digestion is affected by improper
food. An error in diet will cause pain and general
<em>malaise</em>—so will an evil influence or suggestion disorganise
the brain cells and create obstacle and confusion
within their marvellous formation and movement.
A child, from earliest years, needs watching—and
those who have that duty to perform should be
carefully selected persons who are particular as to
general surroundings. A child’s mother or nurse should
be a refined woman of soft voice and gracious manners,
able to control her own moods as well as the moods
of her young charge, so that distinct “character” may
be formed and insisted upon. A “no” should be absolute—a
“yes” equally so. Character “tells” from the
very beginning. The youngest child understands a discipline
of firmness conjoined with sweetness and affection—the
smallest boy has an ineffable contempt for
weakness and vacillation. From the “character” displayed
by their elders, children draw their own conclusions.
An impatient, hot-tempered father makes
callous, indifferent, more or less contemptuous sons and
daughters. Children invariably despise and laugh at
“temper” in their fathers and “fuss” in their mothers.
And the mocking, jeering spirit of scorn is a spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>110</span>
that grows with years, and makes of the person it
dominates an often spiteful and vicious influence in
society, creating mischief and rejoicing in the unhappiness
of others. One sweet, strong, independent character
unconsciously forms the nucleus of many others,
while one soured malcontent infects a whole community.
We have only to consider the “character” of Prussian
militarism—how from two or three blatant and braggart
egotists it has spread its infection through an
entire people, till the brain of the whole German nation
has become clogged with thick and poisonous
thought and has been driven by “insane impulse” to
the committal of the greatest crime in history. If we
would avoid such crimes for the future we must see to
it first that the race is healthily and sanely born,
and secondly that “character” is the only basis on
which all education must be founded, or it will be
merely a house of cards, toppling at a breath. And
the corner-stone on which “character” itself must be
reared is a high and reasonable faith in the Supreme
Cause of all creation, coupled with an earnest and
devout following of the divine order in which that
great Force at the back of all things has ordained this
Universe to move.</p>

<h3>SCIENCE AND RELIGION</h3>

<p>Religion is not what the Churches would have us accept
as such. It is not man-made dogma. So far as
Christianity is concerned, the saying is true that “There
never was but one Christian and He was crucified.”
No more uplifting faith was ever taught than that of
Christ; but it has never been spiritually realised or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>111</span>
fully practised. Read Christ’s own words in the New
Testament, and then ask where shall we find His commands
obeyed? In some exceptional cases there have
been saintly lives and saintly deeds resulting from
the sincere and devout application of the Gospel—but
in dealing with this question we have to think of
mankind in general, not in an individual sense. This
horrible war with its riot of blood and carnage is
a damnatory answer to professing Christianity. Man
has made of himself his own god—and in the God as
revealed or explained in all the conflicting religious
“formulas” he has ceased to believe. Faith of any
kind must be supported by reason. And Science is
the door to the highest heaven of faith. Every new
discovery, every new aid to man’s well-being on the
planet, is a fresh proof of God. It has taken twenty
centuries and more for us to begin learning the wonders
of electricity, though the miraculous force, with all
its component and divergent radiations, was with us
always. It may take us twenty times twenty million
centuries to discover God—nevertheless He is with us,
notwithstanding our intellectual blindness and lack of
Spiritual perception. Science is our peep-hole, through
which we may, even now, glimpse Him, but which in
time to come will not only be our window, but our
open door, through which we may approach Him, full-eyed,
without fear. But, to arrive at this, we should remember
that Science, like every other power bestowed
upon us, must be used sanely; and through “Free-Will”;
that is to say, we may bend its force to either
good or evil. It is good when we use it for the advantage
of humanity—it is evil when we make of it
an agent to injure or destroy humanity. The scien<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>112</span>tist
who employs his abilities to discover means whereby
he may remedy disease, eliminate pain, and assist
his fellow-men to the betterment of life, is that “good
and faithful servant” who, when God comes, He finds
watching—but the scientist, equally brilliant, who devotes
himself to the invention of fiendish instruments
of destruction and death, whereby he may make the
wholesome earth a terror, the sea a snare, and the sky
a scourge, is a warped intellectuality, moved by “insane
impulse,” which, combined with creative activity, makes
of him a devil rather than a human being. Let any
thoughtful person try to realise himself engaged day
and night on the work of evolving some instrument of
death more cruel than any old-time torture, will he
maintain that such persistent concentration on the
means of killing can mould him into a worthier or
nobler individual? But reverse the position and let
him imagine himself absorbed in finding out remedies
for pain and suffering, aids to happier and more useful
living for mankind in general, will he not admit that
however difficult his work may be of accomplishment,
he knows within himself that he is striving for constructive
good, not destructive evil, and that his science
is an output of clear sanity which must bring, not only
deep contentment to his mind, but also the consciousness
that his energies are moving in harmony with the
Divine Spirit of law and order.</p>

<p>This is the true and only religion—to bring one’s
soul into unison with the infinite beauty and reason
which prevail everywhere in Nature. And the Christian
Faith, could it but be relieved from ecclesiastical
dogma, is the truest symbol we have of our spiritual and
immortal destiny, for it teaches the possible god-in-man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>113</span>
which should be born through the purity of woman.
Carry the symbol further, and we find the Crucifixion
of Love through selfishness and hypocrisy—yet another
step, and we are shown the Resurrection from the
grave—“the Light of the World” released from the
stone and seal of priestcraft, breaking free from the
cerements of prejudice, and ascending to the Father
of us all! Search as we may through all the religions
of the world, we shall never find a grander, simpler
“Symbol” of eternal truth than this—the faith preached
by Christ. But it must be divested of its clerical encumbrances.
Like a glorious ship that has lain too
long in harbour, it must be cleansed of weed and
barnacle and launched unhindered into the open sea.
And those who man the ship must be free from self-interest,
from “cranks” and meddlesome theories and
formulas—briefly, they must be <em>sane</em>, with the great
sanity of nature and nature’s immutable laws. Without
this neither Religion nor Civilisation can endure.
They can only be crazed attempts to build that “house
upon sand,” of which we have been told that “the rain
descended and the floods came and the winds blew
and beat upon that house, and it fell; <span class="allsmcap">AND GREAT WAS
THE FALL OF IT</span>!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_14">HAS CHRISTIANITY FAILED?</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Has</span> Christianity failed? No! Men and women have
“failed,” but <em>not</em> Christianity. The very question is to
my mind terrible and blasphemous—one of the many
terrible and blasphemous utterances common to the
Press and current literature during recent years.</p>

<p>It is a shame to a professingly Christian nation that
such a question should be asked at all. The greatest,
purest religion in the world can have no weight with
mere apes of humanity, who practise the most appalling
hypocrisy in front of the sacred altars, and assume to
believe in and to obey Christian precepts, while indulging
to excess in their own private and particular
selfish vices and passions, without restraint and without
regret.</p>

<p>The nations have mocked at God and disobeyed His
laws. It is the old story over again. “The earth was
corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.”
Christ said, “Why call ye Me Lord, Lord, and
do not the things which I say?”</p>

<p>Christianity is based on two great laws—love to
God and love to one’s neighbour; can any one say that
modern civilisation fulfils these demands?</p>

<p>We have only to note the fearful corruption in
Church and State, in every phase of politics and business,
and the unspeakable vices which pollute so-called
“society,” and poison our literature and art, to realise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>115</span>
that the “cities of the plain” were no whit worse than
our own, and merit no less than they a rain of fire.</p>

<p>But Christianity itself, as taught by Christ, towers
above all “failure,” despite the apathy and hypocrisy
of thousands of its professing priests, who in many
instances are as selfish and flagrant blasphemers as the
worst atheist and iconoclast in <em>un</em>christianised and brutalised
Germany.</p>

<p>Without that heavenly faith which helps us towards
the attainment and reverence of the Divine in all
things, what has Germany become? More cruel and
callous, more lost to every sense of decency and honour
than the savages of prehistoric times, she is sowing
the wind and will reap the whirlwind.</p>

<p>But let us take care that we do not join her in
her rush towards annihilation. Political shams and
treacherous intrigues would drag us thither—“Unfaith
in aught is want of faith in all.” If a weak section of
men and women fail to find their souls, Christianity
itself has not “failed,” nor will it fail; because it is the
divine expression of the unconquerable Spirit of Truth.</p>

<p>The most brilliant House of Lies ever built by man’s
careful stupidity falls into dust at the lightest breath
of a truth based on eternal equities. The microbes
in a rotting cheese may deny the existence of the sun
because they do not see it, and may ask, “Has the
daylight failed?” But the sun pursues its glorious
course, lightening the visible universe.</p>

<p>So it is with Christianity. And those who presume
to ask “Has it failed?” are but the microbes in the rotting
cheese.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_15">SNOOKS’S OPINION</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Snooks</span> is one of those entertaining persons who makes
a point of giving an “opinion” on everything. From
the Almighty downwards he has what he calls a “calm
common-sense view” on all subjects in heaven or on
earth, and his chief object in life is to get that “calm,
common-sense view” on all to the front, so that the poor,
purblind, uneducated public who seldom have any time
to indulge in “views,” and still less chance to express
them, may understand that there yet exists one truly
great man of sane and sober judgment—namely,
SNOOKS.</p>

<p>Before the War he used to write letters to the <i>Times</i>
on the urgent necessity there was for complete disarmament.
In fervent language he pressed the reduction
of naval expenses. He was, and is still, under the
impression that the <i>Times</i> is still as it was in ages
past—a British Thunderer; an Oracle which manifested
itself as “I am Sir Oracle; and when I open my mouth
let no dog bark.” He forgets that journalism is now
only a monstrous Syndicate, not expressive of thoughts,
but of Shares and Dividends, and that if the <i>Times</i>
were what it once was, it would not publish any letter
from Snooks. But Snooks is “fixed” in his opinions.
He admits no change in the course of things—an old-established
institution must, without argument, remain
always as such, and must not totter to decay. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>117</span>
decay sets in, despite Snooks, he firmly denies its possibility.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he says—“D’ye think I’ve come to my
time of life without knowing better than that? Teach
your grandmother!”</p>

<p>Just at the time when he wrote letters about naval
expenses and disarmament, one or two other “Snooks’s”
popped up and replied. He was not pleased with their
replies, as they opposed him. So he took up that Scheme
of Idiots, the “Channel Tunnel,” and wasted a deal of
ink in seeking to point out what a fine thing it would
be to spend needless millions on a tunnel which the
Richborough Ferry makes superfluous. His arguments
fell a little flat, and he was for a short period reduced to
writing about “the first primrose in my back garden”—and
“I hope some of your readers have noticed the
very early arrival of the wasp this year,” to the indulgent
<i>Daily Mail</i>. But he never has found quite enough
to do in the way of letter-writing to satisfy his ambition.
There are not enough wrongs for a Snooks to set
right—people of place and position do not make enough
mistakes for a “Snooks” to correct. Daily and nightly
he is consumed by the desire to see his name in print,
and his craving sometimes leads him to look up familiar
Latin quotations, more or less applicable to the political
situation, and to send them (with the usual signed letter)
to certain small newspapers whose position and
reputation make the chance of their editor’s classical
scholarship doubtful. To see himself in print, no matter
how or when, is Snooks’s joy. And now that the
war is blowing the dust of human affairs in all directions,
Snooks has, as some press reviewers say: “come
into his own.” He finds, so he states with engaging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>118</span>
modesty, that if HE had been consulted, there would
have been no war.</p>

<p>“There was that Algeciras business,” he says vaguely,
not knowing in the least what he is talking about. “It
should all have been settled then.”</p>

<p>He knows Viscount Grey personally, so he says, but—“he
never would take my advice”—and as for Kitchener—ah!—“That’s
a man who had immense possibilities!—immense!—but
he was obstinate—he wouldn’t
listen to a word I told him!”</p>

<p>Here, impressed with the reflections awakened by
this melancholy fact, he writes a letter to the <i>Times</i>—a
letter which happens to be just the proper quantity
of “stuff” to fill up the end of a column: so it goes in.
No one pays any attention to it. Snooks shows it to
his friends at the club—they smile, half read it, don’t
understand it and don’t want to understand it. After
some difficulty he gets an old deaf gentleman to look
at it.</p>

<p>“What’s this, what’s this!” says the old deaf gentleman
nervously—“Something happened to our Allies!”</p>

<p>“No, no!” roars Snooks—“It’s a letter!—a letter
I’ve written; I, myself—to the <i>Times</i> about Kitchener!”</p>

<p>“Ah, I wouldn’t do it if I were you!” mildly replies
the old gentleman, with one hand up to his ear—“We
don’t know anything about his <span class="locked">work——”</span></p>

<p>“<em>I</em> know!” shouts Snooks—“If he had taken <em>my</em> <span class="locked">advice——”</span></p>

<p>“Ah, ah! Did you know him?” inquires the old
gentleman, evidently surprised and unconvinced.</p>

<p>“<em>Know</em> him!” Snooks snorts defiance, as much as
to imply that if he knows the inside of his own pocket<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>119</span>
he knew Kitchener still better! In irritable impatience
he watches the old gentleman’s leisurely perusal of his
epistolary effusion.</p>

<p>“Ah! Yes—er—yes! I don’t agree with you,” says
the old gentleman at last, putting aside the paper. “I’m
not quite sure that I understand it, but it’s not the
way I’d put it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right!” and Snooks turns on his heel with a
superior air of disdain. “I suppose you’re for the wasting
of millions! Everybody is, that doesn’t study the
subject. Now <span class="locked"><em>I</em>——”</span></p>

<p>Here a stray man comes to the rescue of the deaf
old gentleman, the conversation changes, and the famous
<i>Times</i> letter is forgotten.</p>

<p>Often Snooks seems to be ubiquitous. His letters
appear in numerous papers, especially the provincial
ones. Sometimes a Snooks’s “opinion” is squeezed just
under the “Space for Special News,” which in many
halfpenny rags is not “Special News” at all, but merely
the results of—Football!</p>

<p>When all the intelligent world was waiting for war
news, a Birmingham paper had a “Space for Special
News” in which football results were printed first and
the war news second! The absurd folly and incongruity
of this sort of thing never seems to strike the syndicated
Press. The effect of it on the minds of our French
and other Allies is too humiliating to be written. It
might draw forth a letter from Snooks, if only Snooks’s
opinion carried weight. But it doesn’t. The greatest
“opinion” that could be imagined, even that of Plato
or Shakespeare, doesn’t much matter to any one. It is
not a time for individual criticism; it is only time for
inspiration and action. A strong thought is always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>120</span>
silent; it resolves itself into deeds rather than words.
There has been altogether too much talk during the
progress of the war; too many “Snookses” in too many
newspapers. Snooks has even cropped up in the House
of Lords, to say nothing of the House of Commons.
And it should be borne in mind that Snooks <em>does</em> nothing;
he is not in the smallest degree useful to his country;
he merely stands, like an old washerwoman leaning
over her tub, and talks. He talks to any one who is idle
and stupid enough to listen. He finds out all sorts of
“queer things” about General this or Colonel that, and
for women he has scarcely a good word to say.</p>

<p>“<em>They’re</em> no use!” he declares contemptuously. “All
their sick nursing and sewing was done just for sheer
man-trapping! Show them some new hats and they’d
forget all about their patients!”</p>

<p>When this heresy is indignantly refuted, he snaps
his mouth in a firm, hard line, as though it were a
steel box.</p>

<p>“I’d bet you a hundred pounds,” he says, “that if it
were women who were wounded in the war instead of
men, you’d hardly find one of their own sex to wait
upon them! They love fussing round a man! It’s a
perfect godsend to them, especially the old maids!
There’s an excitement about it; a sort of morbid interest!
They delight in washing a Tommy’s face and
brushing his hair. If it were one of themselves they’d
scrub the face till the skin was ruined and brush the
hair the wrong way! <em>I</em> know ’em, I tell you! You
give a pretty woman who is ill to an ugly woman who
is well, to be nursed, and she’ll ‘nurse’ her! You’ll
see what she’ll make of her in twenty-four hours! I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>121</span>
tell you I take a calm, common-sense view of all this
sort of bunkum!”</p>

<p>Unfortunately for Snooks, his “calm, common-sense
view” does not appeal to the world in general. It does
not even impress the Premier, who, up to the present,
has failed to consult Snooks respecting the “conduct
of the war,” or to offer him a “portfolio.” He longs
to be consulted. He yearns to be displayed on the
headlines of the halfpenny dailies or Sunday pictorials
in flamboyant beauty, or <span class="locked">as,—</span></p>

<p>“<span class="allsmcap">MR. SNOOKS SPEAKS OUT</span>”; or “<span class="allsmcap">THE GREAT MESSAGE
OF MR. SNOOKS</span>.”</p>

<p>But these things don’t happen. He has still to content
himself with letters to the Press, which sometimes
get read, but more often are passed over and forgotten
altogether. Nevertheless, his “opinion” is in all the
newspapers, whether read or unread, and though the
King has not sent for him yet, and he has no “portfolio,”
he is admittedly and visibly “SNOOKS.” So
that when any particularly mischievous comment on affairs
in general appears in print, or any “calm and
common-sense view,” which gives useful “points” to
the enemy, and irritates the patience of the public, we
know who it is, and we don’t much mind! We merely
say “SNOOKS again!” or “Another powerful letter
from Mr. Snooks will appear next week!”</p>

<span class="subhead">(<i>Written by request for the Navy League</i>)</span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> this greatest War of all history, a War which in
extent, in terrifying armaments, and in massed millions
of men surpasses in fearful slaughter and incalculable
results all the battles ever chronicled from earliest
times to now, why is it that in these Isles of Britain,
the nucleus of the Empire most concerned, there is
so much indifference, apathy, and real ignorance displayed
among the general public of the “man-in-the-street”
type concerning the silent but ever vigilant
work of our Navy? There is no use in denying the
fact—indifference, apathy, and ignorance exist; and
all taken together constitute an extraordinary, wellnigh
alarming national phenomenon. Carelessness
arises from what is sometimes called “cock-sureness,”
and we are amazingly “cock-sure” of ourselves, especially
in naval matters. The levity of our women, apart
from those who are engaged in sick nursing and charitable
works, and who are happily numerous, is almost
unbelievable; their outrageous, not to say positively
crazy “new fashions” in dress, their “dinner dances” at
London restaurants, their “bridge parties,” and their
“night clubs” make one think of the warning words of
the prophet <span class="locked">Isaiah:—</span></p>

<p>“Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice,
ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech. Many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>125</span>
days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women;
for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come!”</p>

<p>For truly the “vintage” of prosperity and the “gathering”
of good for this country of ours would fail, and
fail utterly, if it were not for our resolved and invincible
guardianship of the sea—a guardianship which must
never be relaxed, and which every one of us should
learn to appreciate and help to strengthen by every
means that we may.</p>

<p>We are assured by many sagacious essayists and historians
that it is the women of the nation who make
and who influence the men; and if this be the case,
at least one-half of our British women have cause to
be proud of the splendid fellows they have sent forth
to take part in the vast contest on which such mighty
issues depend. But the other half seem deaf to the
roar of the guns, or to the call of the Sea. The land
forces occupy all the attention of newspaper readers,
and very little information can be gleaned about our
seamen. The women prattle pleasantly about the grim
struggle at Neuve Chapelle or at Ypres; one hardly
ever hears them talk about the long, long hours of long,
long days and nights spent by our silent mariners,
watching from every great battleship and cruiser for the
treacherous foe. Yet every woman should, at the present
moment, be well on the alert; eager, enthusiastic,
and ready to inspire, even to command the youth of the
rising generation; and among other duties falling to
their lot is distinctly that of teaching their own boys,
and other women’s boys too, the inestimable value of
service in the Navy.</p>

<p>That grand protector of our islands, the Sea, is to
Great Britain more than a hundred million of men;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>126</span>
and every boy should learn the history of what it has
been to us, what it is, and what it ever will be, held
by a Fleet which has never been conquered! Every
brave lad’s heart is bound to thrill when he is told
of the magnificent deeds of daring performed by our
naval heroes whose names are household words; but
it is to be feared that of latter years boys have been
encouraged both at home and at school to think more
of “sport” and games of skill than patriotism, and the
special training which would help them also to be
heroic and to “make history.” Lawn tennis is now
regarded as a serious business, but it is only a game,
and a country will never be saved by it. Cricket and
football are equally “games”; neither one nor the other
will drive the foe from our shores should he invade us.
Games are good as “games,” but when they become a
national obsession the hard and fast line must be drawn
before it is too late.</p>

<p>The Sea is our fortress, and so long as that is kept
and guarded by a perfectly trained and efficient Navy,
we need not fear. Nevertheless, to keep that training
and efficiency up to the mark we must show no slackness,
no falling-off; there must be a perpetual addition
of new, youthful, and ardent blood; brave boys and
young men for whom the ever glorious lines of Shakespeare
express life’s utmost truth and <span class="locked">meaning:—</span></p>

<p>I wish that every word of this magnificent outburst
of noble patriotism were learned by every boy in Britain,
and imprinted on his memory, as ineffaceably as
his daily prayer. It is the heart’s utterance of the
greatest poet and truest lover of his country England
has ever produced, and inspires the soul with the same
emotion as that expressed by Sir Humphrey Gilbert,
of Shakespeare’s time and <span class="locked">spirit:—</span></p>

<p>“Give me leave, therefore, without offence to live and
die in this mind, that he is not worthy to live at all
that for fear or danger of death, shunneth his country’s
service and his own honour, seeing that death is inevitable,
and the fame of virtue immortal.”</p>

<p>Great as were the responsibilities and labours of the
Navy in the past, they were nothing compared to those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>128</span>
of the present. In the days of the brilliant and sagacious
Queen Elizabeth, there were no submarines, mines,
or torpedoes, and the historian Camden tells <span class="locked">us:—</span></p>

<p>“This great Armada which had been three complete
years in rigging and preparing with infinite expense,
was within one month’s space many times fought with,
and at the last overthrown, with the slaughter of many
men, not an hundred of the English being missing,
nor any large ship lost.... Whereupon several monies
were coined in memory of the victory, some with a fleet
flying with full sail; others in honour of the Queen,
with fireships and a fleet all in confusion, inscribed
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Dux Fœmina facti</i>, that is, A Woman was conductor in
the Fight.”</p>

<p>At that time the enemy Spanish Fleet came forth
and showed battle, but up to the present the German
Fleet, which took much longer than “three years” to
prepare, has not been much in evidence till its humble
surrender, and its only exhibited warfare was the
treacherous method of torpedoing unsuspecting and
mostly neutral vessels, some of which had no means of
defence. My own heart thrills when I think of our
splendid naval men, whose spirits still respond to Nelson’s
undying signal—“England expects that every man
will do his duty!” The Germans are not a seafaring
race. The British are born and bred “of the sea”;
the salt and savour of it are mixed with their blood,
and for a thousand years they have been accustomed to
it in all its wildest moods.</p>

<p>Herein our Navy has an immense advantage, but
because we are thus fortunately bred, there is no need
that we should forget that breeding, or neglect the long
education we have had, and allow the youth of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>129</span>
country to imagine there is no need of their service.
On the contrary, there is more need of their service
than ever, and for the furtherance of this purpose
we are all anxious that as many of our hopeful lads,
who have a turn for seafaring and adventure, should
join the Navy League at once, and “train” to be
defenders of their country as young and smart “sea-dogs”
of the old, dauntless, unconquerable mettle.
Every help should be given to this end, especially
through the women, the mothers of strong and gallant
boys, who can influence their sons and imbue them
with the true spirit of patriotism, and while we work
to strengthen and replenish this vital and necessary
force on which we depend so much for our defence
and our means of existence, we should think—we who
“sit at home at ease,” of the long periods of watchfulness
endured by the men of our Fleet at sea in waiting
at every turn for each fresh move of an insidious
and unscrupulous foe. We should manage to let them
know that their work is not all in vain; that there are
plenty of young fellows ready to follow them when the
time comes, and join in their splendid service of the
guardianship of the sea.</p>

<p>In this effort, the Navy League is a fine and necessary
institution. It keeps the youthful spirit of the
Navy alive and enthusiastic, and it reminds us of what
might otherwise be forgotten, that far more than all
other defences we rely on the Sea and our Fleet to preserve
our existence and protect us from invasion.</p>

<p>We can help them at home by spreading the Spirit
of the Navy—the spirit of Drake, Frobisher, and Nelson
among all our growing lads who are, in their hearts,
eager to be “up and doing.” I should like to see an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>130</span>
active branch of the Navy League established in every
town and village all over Britain—a centre where
ambitious boys can be sure of receiving sympathetic
attention and assistance for their training; and I think
it would be good and serviceable if women would help
more than they at present do in this work, by teaching
their boys to honour and love the Service, and encouraging
them to read the stories of naval heroism
and naval conquest, so that their minds may be turned
constantly towards ideas of their country’s defence,
their country’s safety, their country’s glory. None of
these things will, or can, be assisted by football, cricket,
or lawn tennis, except as games for physical development;
but by discipline, study of the art of navigation,
and the wonderful ways of Nature in wind and wave,
and by that sincere devotion to duty which brings a
man’s life into safe port as surely as a well-piloted,
well-guarded vessel. A sea-girt land should breed seamen;
we cannot have too many of them. And by early
training such powers may be attained as may build a
bright British lad into his land’s history as an unforgettable
hero. For, as the famous song tells <span class="locked">us:—</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_19">“WHOSO SHALL RECEIVE ONE SUCH LITTLE CHILD!”<br />

<span class="subhead">(<i>Written on behalf of St. Nicholas Home for “Raid-shock”
Children at Chailry, Sussex</i>)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Nothing</span> is lovelier than the sight of a perfectly happy
child—a little, laughing, dancing, restless, sparkling
bit of humanity just beginning to expand into life like
a plant putting forth leaves and tendrils and buds that
promise fairest flowering—a creature of unspoilt confidence
and innocence whose whole consciousness is absorbed
in wonder and delight at the strange newness
of the world around it, and all the beautiful, amazing
things the world offers for its attraction and pleasure.
The flight of a bird—the delicate caperings of a butterfly—the
flicker of sunshine on the wall—the ripple of
water—the sound of joyous laughter and dainty music—all
these pleasures and many more captivate and move
a child to smiling and pleased gesture—the little voice,
the little hands, express wordless ecstasy—the young
eyes glisten with unutterable meanings. Fresh from
the unseen Power that declared “Let us make man in
Our image,” it displays a pathetic faith in good—it
trusts all the big, grown-up people around it in an exquisite
confidence that none of them will allow it to
suffer harm—it accepts life as it finds it, with the beautiful
assurance of a flower which opens to the sun, instinctively
certain that all is, or shall be, well. Let us
remember that a child might never know evil if its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>134</span>
elders did not instruct it therein! It is as innocent as
any other young animal—innocent as a kitten or St.
Bernard puppy, than which nothing is more blunderingly
simple and touchingly confident. If we watch the
unspoilt, natural gaiety and playfulness of all young
things we cannot but realise the truth of the Divine
pronouncement on creation, “Behold, it was very good!”
and that we were meant to be happy on this planet—moreover,
that we <em>should</em> be happy, if it were not that
we cannot leave each other alone—we must always be
backbiting and hurting each other, interfering in our
neighbour’s business and grudging our neighbour his
or her special form of happiness. No child can be honestly
said to know evil till we assure it that evil exists—till
we frown and say “Naughty! That is wrong!”
heedless of the bewildered eyes that mutely ask “Why?”
As the Italian proverb says: “The ‘Why’ of a child is
the key of the Universe.” Generally speaking, a child’s
attitude towards life is one of complete reliance on unknown
but trusted destiny, and in very early years, if
that reliance should be broken, the little spirit so
startled by some cruel blow is seldom or never the same
again. But a few years ago, when we who plead for
the children now were all children ourselves, the phrase
“a bolt from the blue” was a phrase merely, expressing
a possible calamity, too sudden almost to ever take place—and
little did any of us dream that we should be
forced to realise its literal achievement. The ingenuity
of man, warped to devise schemes of wickedness rather
than beneficence, has brought about a state of things in
which the once secure loveliness of the heavens has
become accursed by his vindictive presence, bearing
with him through the offended air the means of destruc<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>135</span>tion
and death to the innocent and non-combatant populations
of peaceful earth places below—and without a
generous human thought for the lives of others, he
speeds his selfish and devilish flight, insanely convinced
that he is a brave man in his efforts to kill his fellow-creatures
from the air, as well as on the land and under
the sea. Nothing more heroic is left to him by his governments,
teachers, propagandists and the like but to
kill—to kill! Were he—apart from the red crime of
War—to murder man, woman, or child in cold blood,
with circumstances of mutilation and burning, he would
be condemned to the gallows—but the wind-blown
scarecrow of a false “patriotism” speaks, nay, shouts,
“Herein killing is no murder!” and he rushes on his
way through the air as though to perform an errand of
mercy instead of slaughter, dropping bombs of destruction
anywhere that seems to him feasible, and when he
can have, as he reports, “good results!” “Good” results!
“O Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they do!” Let us look with the eyes of the mind and
the heart on such a scene as has been enacted many
times recently—a group of little children in a school,
singing their little play-songs, or repeating their earliest
lessons—happy, innocent, confiding—when, suddenly
and without warning, a murderous crash and thunderburst
of explosives is launched from the air through the
roof above them, and where the young lithe bodies a
moment ago disported themselves, there lie mutilated
corpses drenched in blood. Our foes call that “war”—but
I would fain believe that in their own hearts they
know it is butchery, and that they deplore the merciless
militarism that compels them to perform such deeds.
And even worse than death for these little ones is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>136</span>
stunning blow on their mentality—the horrible knock,
as it were, on the delicate membrane of the nervous
system, which bruises it in a subtle, creeping way that
is almost unimaginable. Contrast a healthy, happy
child, playing fearlessly in the fields among the flowers,
with one who is suffering from “raid shock”—and
who sometimes sits lost in a vague stupor, unwilling to
move—afraid to look up at the sky lest something fiendish
should fall from it! I know one such child who
refuses now to raise his eyes from a morose study of
the ground. Hour after hour he sits frowningly absorbed.
Pressed recently to look at the flight of a butterfly
through the air, he gave a terrified glance at it
sideways, and then resumed his downward staring. A
kindly nurse, trying to rouse him, said, “You mustn’t
be frightened of the sky—God is up there!” but he
uttered a little pained cry and covered his face, sobbing,
“No—no—no! Wicked man up there—not
God!”</p>

<p>There is no need to comment on the effect of such
impressions on a child’s vivid imagination; it is altogether
dreadful and disastrous, for who can tell what
damaging results to the brain may be in store for the
innocent little victim! Time and care, with healthful
surroundings and healing influences, may do much
to eliminate the evil and disperse the horror and cruelty
of such experiences—and this is why the “St. Nicholas
Home” exists to-day, thanks to the loving heart and
patience of its founder, Mrs. Kimmins, whose tenderness
for children makes one feel that Her guardian
angel, as well as the angels who watch over Christ’s
little ones, must always “behold the Face of the
Father.” No one with even a small amount to spare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>137</span>
from the multitudinous claims made on the pocket of
the unfortunate British taxpayer, whose Governments
have dragged him into the incredible wickedness of a
war for which he had neither the taste nor the inclination,
will refuse that mite to assist the work of the
“good Saint Nicholas” in the home over which his childhood-loving
spirit presides, while those who are making
much of the “filthy lucre” out of the exigencies and
demands of the nations’ slaughter-houses will perchance
salve conscience by munificence. Some of the donors
may call to mind the story of the father who murdered
his three sons, and whose crime St. Nicholas discovered
in a vision. Going to the inn where the murderer was,
the saint forced him to confess his wickedness, and
forthwith raised the three boys to life again. In this
legend we may find a happy symbol for the “Home” on
whose behalf we plead. For the “raid-shock” children
are, in a sense, murdered, though alive—murdered in
their natural confidence, hope, and gaiety, and crushed
by the oppressive consciousness of an ever-looming evil.
We wish, as St. Nicholas did with the three boys, to
raise them to life again—to re-establish their youthful
trust, to make them forget that there are men who are
devils—but perhaps to persuade them that there are
women who are angels! Women, with mothers’ hearts,
ready to put mothers’ arms round them—to play with
them and talk “fairy bits”—as a sweet little girl asked
me to do the other day—women who will care for them
and see that nothing scares them from their healthful
sleep at night, or their innocent games by day. This
is the object of our appeal for “St. Nicholas Home”—a
worthy cause—a noble, humane, and sacred cause,
for we must “take heed” that we “offend not one of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>138</span>
these little ones.” And most earnestly do I join with
all who have put their shoulders to the wheel of this
great Car of good effort steadily going a stiff way uphill—a
strong push, a big push, and a push all together,
and we shall stand on the shining summit of success
with our saved children gathered round us in the light
of happier days!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_20">APPEAL FOR THE FRENCH RED CROSS<br />

<span class="subhead">(<i>Written for the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, July, 1918</i>)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword"><span class="smcap">Dear Friends!</span></span>—We are here to-day in the name of
France; France, the beautiful, the beloved country,
now ravaged and desolated by the crudest enemy that
ever dishonoured the name of War. I am asked to
make an appeal to you,—to you, the people of the
land of Shakespeare, on behalf of the people of the
land of Victor Hugo,—and I esteem it an honour, a
privilege, and a duty to plead this great Cause. I ask
you to look away from yourselves, your own interests,
your own comforts in this peaceful town, which has
never known the horrors of invasion and destruction
by brutal foes,—I ask you to think of other towns and
villages, once as happy, but now ruined and desolate,
where thousands of harmless people have been driven
out of their homes and forced to endure miseries such
as you have never known! Remember, too, with what
heroism they have borne their sufferings!—with what
courage and fortitude! Never complaining, they have
put their own sorrows and losses in the background for
the sake of their country, and when all the tale is told,
the splendid and unflinching patriotism of France will
shine on the page of history as a deathless example to
all the nations of the world!</p>

<p>Think for a moment what it would mean to you, if
you had to look on at your beautiful old Church, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>140</span>
holy shrine of Shakespeare’s rest, battered into ruins
by the bombs and shells of the remorseless German
foe!—your houses shattered—your gardens laid waste—your
streets broken up by the machines of war, and
you yourselves turned forth as homeless wanderers
without hope or refuge!—your little children murdered
before your eyes! This is what France has had to
endure, and it is your happy fortune to be spared these
terrible calamities only because brave men are fighting
for you and giving their lives for you that you shall
never know such desolation! And not only your own
brave men but the brave men of France are fighting,
for <em>you</em> as well as for themselves! France and Britain
are friends and brothers-in-arms; and in the great and
terrible struggle they fight as one soul! We, who are
protected in our island home by the magnificent heroism
and self-sacrifice of such splendid men, can do but
little to show our grateful love and admiration towards
France for her unmatched endurance, resolution, fortitude,
and courage; but such little as it is and must be,
let us do it with a full and generous heart! Let us
take pride and joy in helping to rebuild the ruined
towns and villages,—let us try to comfort the brave
people by giving homes to the homeless, and restoring
in some measure their lost peace and prosperity. Every
pound that can be spared goes to alleviate some trouble.
No money brings such divine interest as that which
we spend in helping those in need. Therefore let us
not grudge our offerings to the heroic martyr of the
nations! She is pierced with many swords,—she is
scourged and crowned with thorns,—but her invincible
faith and honour and patriotism will bring her through
the darkness to the light of a triumphant and glorious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>141</span>
Day! <em>Her</em> cause is Ours; <em>Our</em> cause is <em>Hers</em>! Now is
the time when we, who are not in the stress of battle,
can cheer and help her by proofs of love and sympathy
in her sorrows. Most earnestly do I hope, and most
ardently do I pray that the noble, ever-living spirit of
the Master Poet of the world whose name and memory
make this town honourable, may so influence your hearts
that you will give freely all and more than you can
spare, in generous tenderness, and with that “quality
of mercy” which brings blessing beyond all wealth,
and reward beyond all fame!</p>

<p>On m’a demandé de m’adresser à vous, mes amis,
à vous qui foulez la terre de Shakespeare, en faveur
de ceux qui foulent celle aujourd’hui dévastée de Victor
Hugo, et je considére comme un honneur, comme un
privilége, et an même temps comme un devoir de plaider
auprès de vous cette grande cause.</p>

<p>Je vous demande de vous recueillir, de considérer
votre situation propre, de jeter un coup d’œil sur votre

aujourd’hui ruinés, désolés, au des milliers de
malheureux innocents ont été chassés de leur foyer et
contraints de subir des misères plus terribles que toutes
celles que vous pouvez imaginer!</p>

<p>Rappelez-vous aussi avec quel héroisme ils ont enduré
leurs souffrances, avec quel courage, avec quelle
force d’âme! Sans se plaindre, ils ont, pour le salut
de leur patrie, refoulé dans le plus profond de leur
être leurs chagrins et leurs angoisses, et quand l’Histoire
parlera, le splendide et inébranlable patriotisme
de la France, brillant d’une lumière étincelante, sera
pour toutes les nations un noble et impérissable

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Far</span> down the long annals of past history we must
look for the beginnings of the brave breed of Worcestershire
men—the outcome of that ancient heroic blood
which nourishes the flower of chivalry and strengthens
the spirit to perform imperishable deeds of valour.
Between a band of tenacious Britons holding the summits
of the Malvern Hills, and a military guard and
outpost of Roman warriors at Worcester itself, was
seemingly produced that special type of Englishman
who, ever since those far-away days, has been famous
for courage and conquest. The native fighting force of
the Gael, and the trained skill and prowess of the
Roman are mingled in his being, and they make him,
almost unconsciously to himself, a hero from his youth.
Something of the salt of ocean, as well as of the salt of
the earth, is in him, bracing his energies and hardening
his muscle and, indeed, if we grope farther back in the
dark recesses of time, we shall find geology suggesting
that Worcestershire was once a sea, and the hills of
Malvern, islands, and that the projecting bluffs on each
side of the gaps in the opposite range were capes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>146</span>
standing out from what some imaginative folk called
the “Severn Straits,” so that we may be permitted to
fancy the earliest progenitors of the Worcestershire
breed were, perhaps, bold mariners, sailing round a
veritable archipelago of islands, and skilfully steering
their primitive craft into harbours sheltered by the very
headlands which confront us to-day; or they might
have been hunters, chasing the innumerable wild beasts
which at one period infested the formerly dense “Forest
of Malvern”—a forest that even in the Middle Ages
stretched from the plains to the very tops of the
hills. Be this as it may, our redoubtable men of
Worcestershire must have been born and bred from
strong beginnings; they come of a stock which knows
no fear, no hesitation, no failure. The “Firm” fighters
whom we delight to honour are the product of centuries
of heroism. Heroism comes so naturally to them that
they think little or nothing of it. Their pride is in
each other—not in themselves individually; what is
said of one man, must be said for the whole Regiment.
Their spirit is expressed in Shakespeare’s <span class="locked">lines,—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“In this glorious and well-foughten field</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We kept together in our chivalry!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And though they have performed prodigies of valour
in bygone great battles, as in the terrific “World War,”
they make no boast of their proved mettle, nor have
they called upon the country they so nobly serve for
special consideration. It is with difficulty, and only by
piecing dry and desultory bits of history together, that
we are at all able to read their Golden Chronicle, or to
realise the nature and worth of their splendid services,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>147</span>
splendidly performed in defence of “This dear, dear
land, this land of such dear souls—This England!”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>We do not know with any certainty the character or
military qualifications of their first Colonel, Thomas
Farrington, who raised the Regiment in 1694, but we
do know many of their brilliant exploits since that
far-off day, especially in India, such as the carrying of
the Delhi Gate and the storming and capture of Bangalore,
which helped to bring about the vanquishment
of that notable rebel, Tippoo Sahib; and though the
overladen pages of historians find little space for special
mention of special companies of soldiers, the Duke of
Wellington’s praise of the Regiment after Badajos has
not slipped notice, nor is it likely to be <span class="locked">forgotten:—</span></p>

<p>“It is the best Regiment in this Army, has an admirable
internal system and excellent non-commissioned
officers.”</p>

<p>But the laurels of the past, thickly showered as they
were on the “Worcesters,” are little to compare with
those of the present, when valour is put to its utmost
test, and when war weapons contrary to all international
usage, more deadly and treacherous than ever were
known before, are employed by the most inhuman and
dishonourable of foes. We have only to recall the
dramatic scenario of the village of Gheluvelt during
the battle of Ypres, when the Worcesters literally saved
the day. No page of romance was ever more thrilling!
The Germans had carried the village, but the Welsh,
true sons of “Gallant Little Wales,” remained, firing,
holding their ground and refusing to admit any sort of
defeat. Even when they had been given the order to
retreat, they hung on with the grim tenacity of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>148</span>
Celtic ancestors, and it depended on the merest chance
as to whether any company of men could advance to
their assistance under the deadly fire of shrapnel which
covered and cut them off from the rest of their line.
But rescue was forthcoming—a mere handful of Worcesters—six
hundred of them, were stationed but a
mile off Gheluvelt. Their commanding officer gave the
order—“Advance without delay and deliver counter-attack.”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Theirs not to make reply,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Theirs not to reason why,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Theirs but to do and die!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>They responded, and rushed for about half a mile
under the battering rain of shrapnel, going for two
hundred yards without cover.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Into the jaws of Death,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Into the mouth of Hell</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ran the Six Hundred!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Shrapnel showered thick and hot in front of them,
and on their right flanks the Bavarians poured bullets
upon them from rifles and machine guns. In crossing
the two hundred yards without “cover” they had one
hundred casualties. But what did death or danger
matter to the Worcesters? What have they ever cared
for shots that have sped their brave souls to Heaven?
They pressed on, up on the left of the splendidly stubborn
Welsh, and opened fire with so much success that
the foe was forced to retreat. The effect of their action
was such that the position was entirely changed—the
Germans fell back and the British line was reinstated.
In Sir John French’s despatch it is <span class="locked">written:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>149</span></p>

<p>“The recapture of the village of Gheluvelt at such a
time was fraught with momentous consequences. If
any one unit can be singled out for special praise it
is the Worcesters.”</p>

<p>Quite recently, a British General, whose name, for
some occult reason or other, was withheld from the
public by the newspaper reporter, gave an enthusiastic
account of the fine deeds of the Worcestershire Regiment
on the Somme.</p>

<p>“The Worcesters have a wonderful record,” he said.
“They have seen some of the hardest fighting of this
war, and they have won new honours for a fine regiment,
which already boasts some of the most glorious records
on our military history.”</p>

<p>We shall do well to think of, and to long remember,
some of this “hardest fighting.” For example, when
they made their wonderful stand against the Prussian
Guards, with the Wiltshires. Some of the incidents
in that fight have never been recorded, and yet, to
those who witnessed them they make the glory of the
Worcesters still more glorious. Listen to the stirring
account of the stirring action!</p>

<p>“The battalions had been fighting incessantly for
weeks, with little or no rest. They had taken trenches
from which the enemy had to be flung out. The subsequent
German attack or counter-attack was delivered
by a force of picked troops, made up of Prussian Guards
and other crack regiments. There were at least ten
thousand of these crack troops. They were supported
by magnificent artillery and had been trained for an
attack over this ground for days before they were sent
against the Worcesters. Judging by the ordinary
standard of things, the weary Worcesters’ battalions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>150</span>
ought to have been crushed and finished under such
an avalanche; but they withstood the fiercest attacks
for two days and nights. They captured many prisoners,
as many as themselves, and the German killed and
wounded were twice as numerous as they. There was
one great mound of dead before the trench, after the
last attack was driven off, the Germans being simply
mown down by the machine guns of the Worcesters.”</p>

<p>“Firm” has ever been the character of the Regiment,
as well as its motto. On five several occasions they have
held their ground and carried strong positions held by
superior enemy forces. They have come triumphantly
through every ordeal—shell-fire, machine-gun fire,
liquid fire, and poison gas, without shrinking or complaint—and
on several occasions the foe himself has
been moved to praise of their splendid heroism. Here
is another <span class="locked">story:—</span></p>

<p>“On one occasion a battalion of the Worcesters was
advancing under great difficulties against a strongly
fortified village. The artillery fire and infantry defence
was stronger even than they expected. For a moment
the battalion seemed to pause. The officer in command
sprang forward with the shout, ‘Firm! Firm! Give
them Worcester Sauce!’ The men responded with a
cheer and laughter—they swept forward, rushing the
position and fighting their way to the rear of the
surprised and baffled foe.”</p>

<p>Think of the time when a little band of these splendid
lads were cut off by a sudden descent of the enemy
in force! They were holding a bit of trench, which was
powdered to ruins by shell-fire, and they were half-buried
under the wreckage; but they dug themselves
out again, and fought with such resolved fury that not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>151</span>
all the forces of the foe could overwhelm or overawe
them. <em>They held their ground for three days</em>—though
every man who wasn’t killed was wounded. When
they were at last relieved they were cheered wildly by
the troops who watched their limping march down to
billets for rest, heroes all, without a single exception!</p>

<p>Such is the “way” of the Worcesters—such has always
been their way from their beginning. Unflinching
valour, duty, and love of country beyond all love of life,
has made them and still makes them what they are.
They, and all their brave and noble kind, have fought
and are still fighting for us that we may dwell in our
homes in peace. It must now be our pride, as well as
our honour, to prove our gratitude to them, not only by
words but deeds. Many of them will return to us,
broken men, deprived of health, strength, and all ability
to work for their living—crippled, blind, disfigured—suffering
too from what we may call mind-hurt beyond
remedy. That is to say, the awful, ineffaceable impression
of ghastly sights and sounds, so inhuman, as to
shame humanity. What shall we do for our self-sacrificing
defenders when they come home? How shall we
assuage their sufferings and seek to make them forget
the terrors they have confronted for our sakes?</p>

<p>In matters of this kind, many people incline to the
old conventional, rather worn-out business of a “War
Memorial,” which conveniently and with all official publicity
and importance, writes the names of living subscribers
as well as those of the heroic dead, but it is
more than likely that the whole face of the Empire will
be strewn with such “War Memorials” in so great a
number that in a short time no passer-by will pause to
look at them. And a monument of cold stone cannot<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>152</span>
come into comparison with the expressed warmth or
loving hearts; so that the best and kindest “Memorial”
to the gallant “Worcesters” who have passed away “in
the stern and grim life-battle, in the morning of their
day”—should be of a nature to care and to provide
for the “Worcesters” who have come alive out of the
Valley of the Shadow, and who remain with us to
witness our recognition of their services. Such a
“Memorial” is proposed by the Mayor of Worcester,
and I, for one, do most heartily wish that his lead could
be followed in every County and Town of Imperial
Britain. For what a fine scheme it is! Could anything
be more practically humane and sympathetic than the
idea that small, pretty cottages or bungalows should
be erected to provide permanent homes, rent free, not
only for the life-disabled men of the Worcestershire
Regiment, but also for Worcestershire Sailors and Soldiers
in other units, similarly disabled, who have “borne
the burden and heat of the day,” and who are entitled
to the country’s heart-whole gratitude. I can imagine
no more beautiful “Memorial” to these brave fellows
than the free gift of charming little houses to live in,
fragrant little gardens to tend, and a fair and peaceful
prospect to look upon for the rest of their days. Nothing
better, nothing kinder could be advised for the permanently
injured and maimed, the sad and battered
wrecks of once strong and comely men—no more comforting
reparation scheme could possibly be thought of—and
it is good to know that much has already been
done, and is being done, to forward its success. The
Mayor of Worcester himself has given the site for
building, and one individual has offered five tons of
lime to assist operations. Then come the Pharmacists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>153</span>
of Worcester, who are willing to supply free all drugs
and medicaments needed by the dwellers on this “Pleasaunce
of Peace”—while the “Old Comrades” of the
County Regiment have incorporated an effort of their
own with the general plan, which has the approval of
the local military authorities. Subscriptions are beginning
to flow in; and when it is fully realised how
welcome and warm “a Home-coming” can, by these
means, be given to the heroes who have sacrificed their
own homes to fight for us, surely every one will be
eager and anxious to contribute to so worthy a cause.
For say what we will, there is a truth in the familiar
<span class="locked">song,—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Be it ever so humble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There’s no place like home!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>And it is within our power to give our broken
Worcestershire men that blessed abode of simple
tranquillity and content, which, if they had not fought
for us they might have earned for themselves. They
will have their pensions from the Government of course,
but we doubt whether those pensions will be as adequate
as they might expect. Anyhow, we of the British
People, who have been defended by their valour, cannot
do too much for them, and if the Mayor of Worcester’s
scheme were copied and carried out all through
the British Isles it would lift a considerable burden
of anxiety from the State. If any “County” must have
a special “War Memorial” to coldly chronicle names of
the dead rather than hearts of the living, there is
nothing in our “Happy Homes” work to prevent the
erection of “marble or the gilded monument,” but to
the eyes of thinkers, philosophers, and all teachers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>154</span>
helpers of mankind, a little village of clustering cottages
on the lovely site which the Mayor has freely given,
commanding as it does an outlook over picturesque
country—cottages with tiny gardens easy to till, plant,
and care for, where in summer the dear old-fashioned
flowers which are a liberal education in themselves,
may bring their beauty and sweetness into lives that
have been blackened by shot and shell—will offer a
far greater and more impressive testimony of memory
and gratitude.</p>

<p>I, who am privileged to write this brief token of
honour and admiration for men whose fine character
and splendid courage have been chronicled by infinitely
worthier pens than mine, now plead this noble cause,
as worthy of the strongest and most loving support of
every man, woman and child in the historic county of
Worcestershire, and I want the spirit of a fine and active
enthusiasm to “catch on” and spread like a prairie fire,
not only through Worcestershire, but even farther afield.
Why should not every county have its own soldiers’
and sailors’ settlement? It’s own well-organised, picturesque
haven and “Pleasaunce of Peace”? It is
impossible that any of us should sit down in satisfied
comfort at the close of the war and do nothing for the
men who have done so much for our defence. A new
“Garden City” would hardly be spacious enough to
provide them with their well-earned ease—and shall we
hesitate to build them villages? Villages so artistically
and prettily planned, so dainty and restful that the
wandering stranger in future years shall pause, enchanted,
to ask what influences have been at work to
create such little Edens on earth. And he will be
<span class="locked">told:—</span></p>

<p>“These are the homes of heroes!—here dwell men
who faced death for duty’s sake and Britain’s honour—and
Britain has given them what she can to prove
her gratitude, and to make their remaining lives sweet.”</p>

<p>For, of every man that has fought for us in this
terrific World-Struggle for nobler freedom and higher
ideals, it can be said with <span class="locked">Shakespeare,—</span></p>

<span class="subhead p1">A TRIBUTE TO THE GRAND FLEET AND ADMIRAL BEATTY</span></span>
</h2>
</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Then said David to the Philistine, ‘Thou comest to me with a
sword and a spear and with a shield, but I come to thee in the
name of the Lord of Hosts.... This day will the Lord deliver
thee into mine hand!’”</p></div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> all know that in Bible history there was a certain
Goliath of Gath. His height was six cubits and a span,—that
is to say, about ten feet. He had a helmet of
brass, and he wore a coat of mail weighing five thousand
shekels of brass,—about a hundred and fifty-six pounds.
He had brass on his legs, and brass between his shoulders,
and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels
of iron. Taking him altogether he was a fine prototype
of the Hun, who is similarly a monster of Brass, Iron,
and Brag. And then DAVID, “ruddy and of a fair
countenance,” drew near to this Brazen Being, and
smote him with a stone in the middle of his forehead,
so that he “fell with his face to earth.”</p>

<p>And this is just what <em>our</em> “David” has done. A
matter for national rejoicing! Especially for “they that
go down to the sea in ships and do business in great
waters” do we rejoice that the “David” of the Grand
Fleet,—high-souled, brave-hearted DAVID BEATTY,—commands
the Sling and Stone of our straight-hitting
Naval Power! What better man than he to take the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>157</span>
place of Nelson?—to carry out with zealous ardour
Nelson’s one wish, Nelson’s last desire that “every man
should do his duty!” Look at the strong face,—the
keen, clear “eyes of the sea,”—the resolute yet tender
lines of the mouth,—the whole bearing of this bold and
dauntless commander, and then think of the lofty and
devout spirit of him expressed in his recent “message”
to the <span class="locked">nation:—</span></p>

<p>“Until religious revival takes place at home, just so
long will the war continue. When England can look
out on the future with humbler eyes and a prayer on
her lips, then we can begin to count the days towards
the end!”</p>

<p>There’s a challenge for you! Flung out unhesitatingly
and manfully in the very face of a swarm of atheists
in Church and State, who for the past decade at least,
have copied Germany in mockery of all things holy
and divine, and have spread their “literary” blasphemies
throughout the land, assisted in their work of “tearing
down” Christianity by a corrupt section of society and
a decadent Press! It’s a challenge we are bound to
hear,—given in simple, manly words which echo the
high faith of him who won the Battle of Trafalgar,
and who, on the eve of the fight retired to his cabin
and wrote this <span class="locked">prayer:—</span></p>

<p>“May the great God Whom I worship grant to my
country, and for the benefit of Europe in general, a
great and glorious victory; and may no misconduct in
any one tarnish it; and may humanity after victory be
the predominant feature in the British Fleet! For
myself individually, I commit my life to Him that
made me, and may His blessing alight on my endeavours
for serving my country faithfully! To Him I resign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>158</span>
myself and the just cause which is entrusted to me to
defend. Amen!”</p>

<p>Without such faith, such humility and resignation
as this, few great victories are won. Even pagan heroes
sought the favour of their gods in every high enterprise;
but in our time the nations of Europe, assuming
an “advancement” beyond either pagans or Christians,
have been seeking to ignore the Higher Power Almighty
altogether; with what dire results is now witnessed by
desolated peoples drenched in blood and tears! Of
Nelson it is written: “All men knew that his heart was
as humane as it was fearless, and that there was not in
his nature an alloy of selfishness or cupidity, but that
he served his country with a perfect and entire devotion,
therefore they loved him as truly and fervently as
he loved England.”</p>

<p>Cannot each word of this be said with equal truth
of David Beatty? Every man of the Fleet will answer
“Yes!” And every man of the Fleet will endeavour
to be a copy of him in all the grand essentials of honour
and duty. And here comes in a little story.</p>

<p>Only the other day I received a letter from a lad on
board one of our mine-sweepers,—a stranger to me
personally, but one who evidently felt sure (as he
might) of my interest in his difficult and dangerous
work. In that letter he <span class="locked">writes:—</span></p>

<p>“I am in his Majesty’s Navy and I am just twenty.
My last ship was Admiral Beatty’s Flagship, the <i>Lion</i>,
on board of which I had the honour of being a little
over three years under <em>an Admiral whose qualities are
magnificent</em>. I want to say this, because people are apt
to take doubtful views through articles in the papers
about our truly Great Leaders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>159</span></p>

<p>Yes,—“articles in the papers,” written by caterers
for mere sensational gabble, are apt to influence the
majority of fools; and “doubtful views” are generally
entertained by persons who in themselves are more than
doubtful. But if a boy of twenty, after serving for
three years under Admiral Beatty, can write, “<em>His
qualities are magnificent</em>,” it means a very great deal.
Young fellows of that age are not always easily impressed
by their superiors,—they are more critical than
complimentary; and the rules of naval discipline go
hard with them unless administered by a kindly as well
as just hand. “Eyes of the Sea” must be everywhere
vigilant,—watching men’s minds equally with God’s
stormy waters,—ever on the look-out for enemies of
the soul as well as enemies of the country; and so
well and truly do they watch,—so faithfully have they
always watched, that sailors’ eyes have grown to be
quite different to all other eyes in the world! We know
them at once by their far-off steady gaze—by their look
of mingled pathos, persistency, and cheerfulness,—by
the sparkle of the waves and the light of stars which
are somehow commingled in their keen glances, suggesting
the wonderful power and indomitable energy of
“one life, one flag, one fleet!” The strong lines of
Alfred Tennyson, the last worthy Laureate of Great
Britain, may well ring in our ears <span class="locked">to-day:—</span></p>

<p>True enough, we have to deal nowadays with pirates,—not
true naval men,—with burglars, not warriors,—and
inhumanity being the characteristic of all such
folk, the international laws of Imperial Britain and her
Allies, regulating the conduct of warfare, have no hold
on them. We are not at war with an educated people,—for
they have shown themselves openly as savages. But
though the wholesome air may be poisoned by the breath
of the Hun, and murderous bombs may be flung through
those spaces of heavenly blue, once most blessedly free
from the presence of humanity, we have already proved
equal to tackling the Zeppelins, and shall tackle them
yet again. And we shall “manage” the submarines in
a way of our own, if only the garrulous and indiscreet
Press will leave us alone to do it, and refrain from giving
elaborate details of all our newest machinery in their
columns for the benefit and instruction of the enemy!
We would not “tell it in Gath” to Goliath, how many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>162</span>
of his under-sea “sneak” boats have already been
“bagged” by our sportive captains—that’s a “secret of
the Admiralty.” But it is just possible that even Huns
may be weary of the certainty of death by fire in the
air, and death by “ramming down” to the bottom of
the sea! Neither way is a pleasant exit from the world
of living men. Both are the result of inventive science
put to wrong uses,—namely to injure, instead of to
benefit. The old ways of combat were more open and
honourable. Better the sword and shield than the gas
and the bomb,—better the fair fight between ships confronting
each other boldly on the ocean, than the floating
mine or the sly torpedo, sneaking like a low thief
beneath the waves. There is something cowardly about
the new “scientific” weapons of war,—they manifest
the assassin’s spirit rather than that of the honest soldier.
The long-distance gun, the poison-vapours, the
“dum-dum” bullet—all show the inventive faculty of
murderers in training, not the sane education of civilised
and honourable men. There has been much talk
of “advancement”—but if human progress takes the
form of “scientific” torture, barbarity, and outrage on
our fellow-creatures, it is not progress at all, but terrible
retrogression and back-sliding which must be checked
before it is too late. No man can do better than see
to it that what has been written of Nelson may also be
said of <span class="locked">him:—</span></p>

<p>“All men knew that his heart was as humane as it
was fearless.”</p>

<p>We <em>say</em> this, <em>think</em> this, and <em>feel</em> this of David Beatty,—and
by the Almighty’s grace and power, we want to
say, think, and feel the same of every man and boy
under his command! And so the Fleet will be as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>163</span>
always has been,—the star of victory in the crown of
Empire. On the memorable occasion when Mr. Lloyd
George rose to make his first address to the House as
Prime Minister, Admiral Sir H. Meux, Member for
Portsmouth, <span class="locked">asked:—</span></p>

<p>“Will the right hon. gentleman say a word about the
Navy before he sits down?”</p>

<p>And the new Premier replied at <span class="locked">once:—</span></p>

<p>“My hon. and gallant friend knows that the achievements
of the Navy speak for themselves. I do not think
that anything I can say would be in the least adequate
to recognise the enormous and incalculable services that
the great Navy of Britain has rendered, not merely to
the Empire but to the whole Allied cause. Not merely
would victory have been impossible, but the war could
not have been kept on for two and a half years had it
not been for the services of the Navy.”</p>

<p>These words called forth ringing cheers. For it is
We,—we Britons—who sweep the seas! It is our heritage
to do so. A rumour is about that one of the “peace
terms” foolishly proposed by Germany is, that we
should “abandon our supremacy of the sea!” As well
ask the sun to abandon its supremacy of the skies! It
would be an evil day for <em>all</em> nations, not only our own,
when Britannia ceased to rule the waves! Her just,
wise laws of freedom and fairness would soon be replaced
by ruthless piracy, and there would be no security
for any coast. It is a good thing for America and
Europe likewise that this</p>

<p>What stories I could tell, had I the time and space,
of heroic deeds “unwritten and unsung” performed by
the men of the Fleet, not only in the past, but now!—now,
in these actual present days, when great London,
plunged to the neck in a flood of gold, poured in for the
help, healing, and comfort of our fighting men on land
and sea, is striving, like a giant caught in a net, to disentangle
its sacred duties from its selfish pleasures,—trying
to realise in its vague way that War is really
War! Of “Tommy” one hears much; but of “Jack
Tar” less,—though they are close comrades in the one
spirit of devotion to duty, and each has his own burden
of difficulties to bear,—his own sphere of danger to
surmount and to master. The story of brave Jack Cornwell
thrilled every heart,—putting well into the shade
the similar exploit of “Casabianca,” of whom, when we
were children, we all learned, in the verse of Felicia
<span class="locked">Hemans:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“The boy stood on the burning deck,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Whence all but him had fled;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The flame that lit the battle’s wreck</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Shone round him o’er the dead.”</div>

<p class="in0">and</p>

<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indentq">“The noblest thing that perished there</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Was that young, faithful heart.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>165</span></p>
<p>Only there is no poet among us worthy of the name
to “sing the memory” of Jack Cornwell, thanks to the
swarm of atheists, pessimists, decadents, and anti-idealists
who have been encouraged to darken and disgrace
the literary annals of Great Britain. “Casabianca”
was a boy about thirteen years of age, son to the
Admiral of the <i>Orient</i>, who remained at his post in the
Battle of the Nile after the ship had taken fire and all
the guns had been abandoned, and perished in the explosion
of the vessel when the flames had reached the
powder. All who have read the enthralling pages of our
sea-history will remember that the <i>Orient</i> was the
French Admiral’s ship, carrying a hundred and twenty
guns, and that he himself died on her quarter-deck, his
little son remaining at the post where his father had
placed him, all unconscious of his father’s end. “Soon
after nine o’clock,” says the historian, “the <i>Orient</i>
appeared in flames, which spread with astonishing rapidity,
and by their prodigious light the situation of the
hostile fleets could be seen at a distance of fifteen miles.
The <i>Orient’s</i> crew, however, continued to fire from her
lower-deck to the very last, and at about ten o’clock she
blew up with an explosion which was felt by every vessel
to the bottom of its keel. To this succeeded a silence
not less awful,—the sanguinary conflict ceased on both
sides,—and the first sound that broke that portentous
stillness was the splash of shattered masts and yards
falling into the sea.”</p>

<p>So “Casabianca” perished gallantly—but not more
gallantly than Jack Cornwell. Both boys, the one
French, the other English, were made of the same
heroic stuff that gives worth and honour to the nations
that breed it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>166</span></p>

<p>Very quaint and poetic it is to read at this time
of day, the picturesque record of William Camden,
Clarencieux King-at-Arms to Queen Elizabeth, concerning
the entrance of the Spanish Armada into
English <span class="locked">waters:—</span></p>

<p>“The next day the English discovered the Spanish
Fleet with lofty Turrets, like Castles, in front like a
Half-Moon, the wings thereof spreading out about the
length of seven miles, sailing very slowly, though with
full sails, the Winds being, as it were, tired with carrying
them, and the Ocean groaning under the weight of
them.... But so far was it from terrifying the seacoasts
with its name of ‘Invincible’ or with its dreadful
Show, that the young Gentry of England, with incredible
Cheerfulness and Alacrity (leaving their parents,
children, wives, and friends at home) out of their hearty
Love to their Country, hired ships from all parts at
their own private charges and joined with the Fleet
in great numbers.”</p>

<p>I think we, in our present days, have had the word
“invincible” thrown at us a good deal from the braggart
mouth of the “Hun”—but “so far from terrifying
us”—it has had the same effect on our manhood as it
had in Tudor days so far as “incredible Cheerfulness
and Alacrity” are concerned! And Queen Elizabeth
apparently found a prototype of Nelson and David
Beatty, for, says Camden, “The command of the whole
Fleet she gave to Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham,
Lord Admiral of England, of whose fortunate Conduct
she had a very great Persuasion, and whom she knew
by his moderate and noble carriage, to be skilful in
sea-matters, wary and provident, valiant and courageous,
industrious and active, and of great authority and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>167</span>
esteem among the seamen of her Navy. Drake, whom
she appointed Vice-Admiral, joined with him.”</p>

<p>Queen Bess evidently knew how to select the best
men! And we may justly claim to have kept up the
breed. For there is not a word written of Admiral
Lord Howard in those old days that cannot be equally
written now of Admiral Sir David Beatty. Every man
of the Fleet knows it; and is proud and glad to serve
under his command. “Skilful in sea-matters, wary and
provident, valiant and courageous, industrious and
active, and of great authority and esteem among the
seamen of the Navy!”</p>

<p>And we shall do well to remember that on the outbreak
of war, the country was assured that the Mercantile
Marine accepted the risks incurred in maintaining
the supplies of food so indispensable to the existence
of the people, and in ensuring a path of safety for
commerce, and the transport of troops and war material.
And British shipmasters, officers, and seamen alike expressed
their resolve to keep the seas open at all costs.
The result of this inflexible determination is that
throughout continuous struggle, exposed to daily and
nightly peril from mine and submarine, British ships
continue to arrive in British ports and sail again with a
splendid disregard of all the difficulties and dangers
which beset them in maintaining the overseas trade of
the nation. It is time such priceless valour was more
absolutely defended and held dear by the Empire which
owes it so much. Our merchantmen should be armed.
The expenditure would be less than the loss of heroic
lives! Merchant seamen should be given every possible
means of protecting their own existence and securing
the safety of their ships and cargoes. Their foes are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>168</span>
ruthless,—they should be given ample means of retaliation
and defence. <span class="locked">For—</span></p>

of the enemy, that they may be a safeguard!—and that
the inhabitants of our Island may in peace and quietness
serve Thee, our God!”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Amen, and many times Amen! And it is possible
that Admiral Sir David Beatty, like his great prototype,
Admiral Lord Nelson, may have sent the same message
to the Fleet on the day of the German surrender which
Nelson sent after the Battle of the Nile, <span class="locked">thus:—</span></p>

<p>“Almighty God having blessed his Majesty’s arms
with Victory, the Admiral intends returning Public
Thanksgiving for the same at two o’clock this day, and
he recommends every ship doing the same as soon as
convenient.—Signed, <span class="smcap">Horatio Nelson</span>. August 2,
1798.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>A similar devotional spirit inspires our “David” of
the sea, when he says that England must look to the
future “with a prayer on her lips.” This great War,
the greatest in all history, will, with all its wickedness
and bloodshed, prove a blessing, if the cloud of Atheism
which has swept over us through perverted and decadent
German ideals, is rolled away,—leaving a clear and
wholesome heaven of faith and hope for a nation brought
back to God through humility, self-sacrifice and splendid
heroism!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_23">IS ALL WELL WITH ENGLAND?<br />

<span class="subhead">A QUESTION OF THE MOMENT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Yes,</span> all is well!</p>

<p>Or, rather, let us say all <em>will</em> be well! And in our
steady progress towards future good we may confidently
aver that all is well even now. Even now! though the
great “spring-cleaning” of the Empire’s house is scarcely
half-way through. Our home is topsy-turvy, familiar
objects are thrust aside, our goods and chattels are
disarranged and turned out to be swept or beaten or
otherwise relieved of their accumulated dust and cobwebs,
and the clatter of brooms and pails and general
hurry-scurry, with many irreparable breakages, make
comfort and quiet impossible. Yet there is a freshness
in the air, the windows have been cleaned, and one can
see the sky through their lately begrimed and sooty
panes, the floors are swept and the furniture polished;
deft hands are arranging flowers for the rooms—we may
breathe in health and hope if we will.</p>

<p>There is much yet to be done, for the cleansing of a
nation is God’s work more than ours, and He leaves no
corner unvisited. He has not done with England yet,
no, not by any means! The festering mass of diseased
moral fibre resulting from a long worship of Self, the
canker in the body social and politic, has to be cut out
ruthlessly, despite bleeding veins and torn sinews, and
God will not spare the remedial knife.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>172</span></p>

<p>But even so, it is well for England! Well, and more
than well! For no greater ill could chance to her than
her condition prior to the war.</p>

<p>Far more injurious to her fair fame than the murderous
attacks of the most dishonourable and unscrupulous
enemy she has ever known was the stealthy undermining
of her people’s ideals through the slow but sure
rot which had begun to set in at the very core of her
civilian life. That rot was eating its way through
commerce and crumbling down every bulwark of society.
Its ravaging microbes swarmed through every
channel—the pulpit, the stage, and all forms of art.
Through its influence the abominable crimes of Sodom
and Gomorrah were re-enacted and condoned, both in
the political and social world. By gradual and subtle
process, step by step on the downward grade, the unthinking
public were led by certain writers of the Press
who are special pleaders for vice, to accept sensuality
as the only meaning of love, and every town possessing
a bookseller’s shop was flooded with published outpourings
of sickly and degrading sexuality, insulting to
the self-respect of men and women, old and young
alike. Girls and boys hardly in their teens carried these
vile books in their hands, and read and discussed them
without shame. Their poisonous trail is over many a
young mind, and the mischief they have wrought will
take years of undoing.</p>

<p>This kind of pernicious literature, coupled with a
“sensational” Press, by which I mean that side of the
Press which truckles to the baser inclinations of mankind,
and flaunts pictorial representations of semi-nude
women of the stage and of the demoralised portion of
Society in the eyes of decent folk whether they will or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>173</span>
no, is in a great measure responsible for the recklessness,
extravagance, sloth, and selfishness which have
disfigured social England for the past decade.</p>

<p>Things were getting worse and worse; men who
truckled to vice were paid with baronetcies as “hush-money,”
women passing for “ladies,” lower than the
lowest of street sinners, because they had education
and opportunities which the street sinner has not, were
praised as embodiments of all the beauties and all
the virtues, and “home,” that dear possession of the
faithful soul, was voted “dull” by the younger folk,
because of its wholesome restrictions on harmful impulses
and runaway passions.</p>

<p>And let us not imagine these clouds on the sun of
our country have yet passed away. They are passing,
but the full splendour of the light is not yet. “Home,
<em>dull</em> Home,” is coming back to its own as “Home, sweet
Home” once more, because a dark and threatening destiny
has torn sons from their mothers, and has broken
up dear associations which were unvalued, because possessed.
Now that death has darkened many windows
and shut many doors, the bereaved ones begin to realise
what “home” really was in the past days of peace, and
what it never will be again; while those that are absent
on the battlefield, amid the roar of the guns and the
storm of shot and shell, turn back wistfully to the
memory of days spent “at home,” in a tranquillity of
mind and body that seemed “dull,” but that now shines
forth in the visions of the brain as a reflex of positive
heaven.</p>

<p>Few, I think, have taken the trouble to consider
what this Empire would become without the saving
grace of “Home”—that oasis in the desert where love<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>174</span>
has its best chance and friendship its surest footing.</p>

<p>It is in very truth the foundation of national safety
and the basis of educational progress, and yet it is
what a very large majority of us have lately esteemed
but lightly, moved as we have been by a spirit of
strange unrest, impelling us to wander hither and
thither in search of satisfaction which, after all our
quest, awaits us at our own door.</p>

<p>Suppose that one and all we ran “amok” in the
liberty which speedily degenerates into license, without
any restraining hand? Would it be “well for England”
then? We know it would not, yet if our young
people are brought up to disdain and to neglect their
parents, and “friends” so-called, only seek other
“friends” in order to make use of them for their own
ends, the social code will be one of pure egotism without
a shred of conscience to soften its hard and fast self-seeking.
This would not be “well for England,” and
from this point of view alone we have to be thankful
for the scourge of this terrific war. For here God has
taken the lead. He has indeed “put down the mighty
from their seat, and has exalted the humble and meek,”
for the humblest ranks of our British fighting men
are heroes to-day, and the true spirit and mettle of the
British race, long suppressed beneath a featherbed softness
of prolonged peace, have sprung up in splendid and
unbroken strength, proving in deeds more than words
that “all is well with England!”</p>

<p>No praise can be too high for their courage, cheerfulness,
and self-sacrifice; the sword of their unquenchable
valour has long been sheathed, but it has not grown
rusty—the blade is as bright as ever it was.</p>

<p>This is something to be proud of, something for us<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>175</span>
to remember when inclined to pessimism. We have
nothing to fear on the score of our warriors who have
gone forth in the flower of their manhood, to contend
with and to conquer a brutal foe; and, if the creeping
suggestion that all is <em>not</em> well with England steals into
our minds, it is on account of <em>traitors at home</em>.</p>

<p>Yes, <em>there</em> is a dire possibility of mischief, a chance
of infinite harm being wrought on England, and on the
whole British Empire by the avarice and short-sightedness
of some of our leading men who have “axes to
grind.”</p>

<p>It may be unpleasant to face the truth, but surely
it is wiser and safer to do so than to wait till it overwhelms
us. And the merest tyro in diplomacy, the
most casual looker-on at the moves on the political
chess-board, can see how many a man “in official capacity”
is playing the German game, and manœuvring
towards a patched-up “peace” which shall give Germany
every possible trade advantage.</p>

<p>The people’s confidence is being daily betrayed by
such treacherous hypocrites, some of whom have financial
interests closely bound in with Germany, and who
hesitate and shuffle and delay action indefinitely, though
the slaughter of innocent thousands may pay the price
of their ineptitude.</p>

<p>In such scandalous matters, all is <em>not</em> well with
England—and all will never be well, unless the people
take a hand against their own spoliation and betrayal.
And they cannot begin too soon. The house of the
nation is being “swept and garnished.” We shall need
to take care that the “unclean spirit” of Germany does
not take “seven other spirits more wicked” to “enter in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>176</span>
and dwell there,” so that “the last state” of that house
be not “worse than the first.”</p>

<p>We need the resolved spirit of Queen Elizabeth,
whose proclamation against certain troublesome foreigners
“which had flocked to the coast towns of England”
in 1560, commanded that they “should depart the realm
within twenty days,” whether they liked it or not, “upon
pain of imprisonment or loss of goods.” Queen Bess
did not put on gloves when dealing with treachery; she
hit it fair and square in the face. We should do wisely
to imitate her example.</p>

<p>No great reforms are ever accomplished without
opposition from prejudiced and self-interested persons,
and it needs a strong soul to stand firm and full-fronted
against malcontents, and to steadily baffle political
intrigues. With these latter, the Ministry is hemmed
in and environed, and it is a regrettable fact that in
some quarters “party” is ready to overwhelm patriotism,
despite all plausible assurances to the contrary.</p>

<p>On this point I would venture, as an independent
writer who has no favours to seek and no “axe to
grind,” to warn our more or less passive, silent, and
patient people of dangers ahead.</p>

<p>The people are the nation, the people whose labour
makes the wealth of the country are the worth of the
country; and for them the name of Britain should
represent all things British. But unless they themselves
take good care, their trades will be again swamped
by Germany in the future as in the past, especially if
they put in less hours of work. It stands to reason
that if a British workman will only work for eight
hours, and a German will work for fourteen or sixteen,
the German will score in every kind of labour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>177</span></p>

<p>Even now the German is preparing for the relaxing
of “restricted” trades. The goods which the British
Government declared “unnecessary” in time of war are
being “made in Germany,” and at an opportune moment
will be “dumped down” on these shores before the
Englishman, returned from battle, can so much as set
his house in order.</p>

<p>We may think, or we may hope, that protection
against such unfairness will be guaranteed by Government—but
will it? Does it look like it even now?—when
Germans are permitted to run the business of
absent Englishmen, and to make profit therefrom!</p>

<p>Sometimes it would almost seem as if there were a
certain numbness or apathy in the minds of the British
people here at home, which robs them of “the native
hue of resolution,” so that in</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">“Enterprises of great pith and moment</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With this regard their currents turn awry</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And lose the name of action.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">There is a general tendency not to take too much
personal trouble over any matter, a desire to avoid
“being bothered,” and a persistent jog-trot in the same
old way, like “dumb, driven cattle,” no matter whether
the road lead to prosperity or ruin. This is like the
fatal lethargy which overcomes the traveller in heavy
snow, when he yields himself to a sleep from which
he shall never wake.</p>

<p>Half the people in these islands do not yet realise
the full meaning or the real horror of the war in which
we have been forced, by all the rights of law and
liberty, to engage. They do not think—they cannot.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>178</span>
Their sense of perception seems stunned as by a heavy
blow. All religion, all faith, all hope, have in a great
measure failed them. They do not see why they should
suffer undeservedly.</p>

<p>A poor woman receiving the news that her son was
killed, had no tears—her face grew white and stiffened,
as with frost—but she had nothing to say except this:
“Ah, well! I couldn’t expect anything else, as there’s
no God left to us now! Only man, the devil!” She
could but realise that the war is man’s work—the result
of his miserable ambitions, his delight in destruction,
his selfish pride and cruelty. And the church had
taught her little more than that the God she was told
to worship was “a jealous God,” and out of that saying
little comfort can be drawn for the broken heart of a
bereaved mother.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most terrible notes struck from
the great thunder-echoes of the war is this apparent
failure of all churches to cope with the sorrow that has
swept over all lands, destroying homes that were once
happy.</p>

<p>Our Lord’s pitiful and pathetic words are realised
to-day:—“Because iniquity shall abound the love of
many shall grow cold.” Ah, yes, love for Him and
all the tenderness He taught <em>has</em> “grown cold,” and
many of His professed ministers are tongue-tied and
spirit-frozen, and seem all unable to raise the broken
lives from the dust of despair, or dry the weeping eyes
which are too tired and heavy to lift themselves to
heaven.</p>

<p>There is a strong instinctive sense among us all, no
matter to what sect we belong or what religious formula
we profess, that if the churches had ever truly taught<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>179</span>
and truly followed the example of Christ, war and its
horrors would have been impossible. For He gave us
only two commandments—two instead of the Mosaic <span class="locked">ten—thus:—</span></p>

<p>“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
and with all thy soul and with all thy mind. This is
the first and great commandment. And the second is
like unto it—thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
On these two commandments hang all the law and the
prophets.”</p>

<p>Who is there that can deny that if these two commandments
had been obeyed by man in his social and
civil life, the whole face of things would have changed
to an almost divine betterment, and the world’s progress,
assisted by a sanity of thought and a clarity of action,
would have been towards beauty and spiritual uplifting?</p>

<p>The word “spiritual” is sadly wronged and degraded
nowadays by misguided or semi-crazed persons who
“blaspheme the Holy Ghost” by their pretensions to
psychic power, and play with the names of scared things
in order to further their own sinister designs. Our
Lord prophesied this evil when He spoke of “false
prophets” who should “show signs and wonders,” insomuch
“that if it were possible they shall deceive the
very elect.”</p>

<p>Is it not a fact that we have come upon such days?
Days when the pure, simple, and helpful ethics of
Christ are set aside in exchange for an insane credence
in the vulgar trickery of “mediumship,” “crystal-gazing,”
and other base forms of superstition pertaining
to the eras of ignorant barbarism? Does it seem believable
that there should be so-called “intellectual”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>180</span>
men in this country, even statesmen of admitted ability,
who are actually partially under the sway of illiterate
“mediums,” generally women, who pretend to hold
communication with the dead, and even presume to
offer advice from the “spirits” on the affairs of the
nation and the prosecution of the war? One could
hardly imagine a wilder improbability, yet it is an
absolute fact! The names of persons in high and
trusted positions are on the books of the unscrupulous
jugglers and tricksters who earn their wicked living by
mischievous tampering with the brains of their dupes
and victims, and the wonder is that these notabilities
should so feebly allow themselves to be duped and victimized.
But one has only to think of the entire submission
of the Romanoffs to the villainous machinations
of that unspeakable “monk,” Rasputin, to realize that
there is no depth of abasement to which the human mind
may not fall if it loses its hold on God.</p>

<p>It has to be confessed there are very few indications
of real religion among us at present. A large portion
of the clergy seem stricken with ineptitude, and one
longs for a strong man who would not only preach the
truth, but <em>live</em> it. A narrow egotism disfigures the
ministering spirit of the Church, and I could name more
than one cleric whose absorption in self entirely blinds
him to the real duties he is called upon to do.</p>

<p>The service of Christ should be broad and all-embracing,
generous, cheerful, ungrudging, and untiring
in the aid of all humanity, rich and poor, old and
young, sinful and sorry, and only men who are prepared
to work on these lines should be admitted to such a
high and holy calling.</p>

<p>But things are moving, and will move in the right<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>181</span>
direction presently; when the roar of the guns has died
away and the memory of our slain heroes weighs on our
stricken souls with sorrow and shame, and we have time
to reflect that it is for us and the saving of our honour
that they have died.</p>

<p>We shall then lift our eyes to Him from Whom
cometh our strength, we shall unite in a grand revolt
against hypocrisy and shams; we shall hold our homes
more preciously, seeing and knowing what blood has
been shed to keep them inviolate, and we shall value
simplicity and purity of life for ourselves and our
children far more than wealth and the fleeting, feverish
pleasures which wealth can attain.</p>

<p>In this new dawn of our day it will be well for
England!</p>

<p>One of the happiest and most hopeful auguries for
the future is the stimulus given to agriculture and the
“life of the land” by the necessity of providing food
supplies for our own people on our own soil.</p>

<p>The menace of the submarine has done this for us,
and devastating as its brutal work has been, we may
regard it as a blessing in disguise. For we should not
need to depend on foreign imports of food if we utilised
our own acreage as fully and diligently as we might.</p>

<p>Life in the country, work in the country, means
health and a light heart; and many there are who
would like to see the olden days of purely native production
come back again—the days of home spinning,
home weaving, home manufacture of every kind carried
on in all the towns and villages of rural England.</p>

<p>Here and there of late years there have been some
efforts in this direction—there is a spinning and weaving
school at Haslemere, at Stratford-on-Avon, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>182</span>
elsewhere—but the support given to these praiseworthy
industries is not sufficiently certain and prolonged to
push them with sufficient prominence into the public
notice. Nevertheless, many a woman helps the movement
by electing to wear only home-woven goods; they
are beautiful and artistic enough to deserve patronage,
and can be purchased direct from the weavers and spinners
without the intervention of the middle-man whose
business is “profiteering.”</p>

<p>What an England it might be—what an England it
<em>will</em> be—when every acre of suitable soil bears its
weight of golden grain!—when every orchard’s value
can be appraised by its measure of luscious fruit!—when
farmyards are full of cattle, and good wives are
so clever at poultry and dairy work that the country
can do without “millions of foreign eggs”—having such
“millions” of its own—and when prosperous farms in
the country are esteemed more valuable possessions than
houses in town, where money is often uselessly wasted
on so-called “pleasures” which have their end in damaged
health and “vexation of spirit”!</p>

<p>To my own mind there is nothing more lovely or more
satisfying than the life of the country, where one may
see the real breadth of the sky, and feel the real freshness
of the air.</p>

<p>In great cities, where humanity is a mere hive, the
houses of brick and stone block out the sky and impede
the air, and somehow one imagines that God is a long
way off, while in the country He seems “nearer than
hands and feet.” Everything speaks of His infinite
care and providence—the birds, the flowers, the trees,
the murmur of the leaves that clap together like little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>183</span>
fairy hands in the wind, and the low, sweet, sigh that
sways through the long grass at sunset.</p>

<p>The nearer man approaches to Nature, the more he
becomes conscious of a Divine, mysterious Presence to
which his whole being instinctively, though almost unconsciously,
responds as “Our Father.”</p>

<p>In the rush and roar of great cities he loses this
delicate intimacy with his own origin, and all that is
or might be divine in himself becomes lowered to the
level of gross material needs and ideas which are the
reflex of the coarser atmosphere around him.</p>

<p>The dweller among country sights and scenes is an
idealist—sometimes even a poet, though he may never
express himself in words—and many an ordinary labourer
turning the rich clods of soil with the plough can
be found who will at times say things both trenchant
and eloquent which will give food for thought to the
most cultivated stylist.</p>

<p>Some people imagine that cities educate, and that the
country does not; but one may question whether it is
not quite the other way about. In any case, the life of
the country makes for health and strength, and these
are two potent factors for happiness. No man can be
happy or contented if he is ailing and weakly, and in
our many “new” systems of education, which are now
being so much talked of, it is to be hoped that health
for the children will be the first thing to be considered
and maintained.</p>

<p>Here I may perhaps touch upon a point where one
may trust that “all is well with England,” in the immense
change the war has wrought as regards the position
of women in the State.</p>

<p>Some years ago I was one of the many who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>184</span>
strongly opposed to the “Votes for Women” movement,
judging it to be wholly unnecessary.</p>

<p>I had been brought up on the chivalric view of man
as taken by Sir Walter Scott in his immortal romances,
and my idea, gathered from these exalted specimens
of the race, was that as man was always ready to worship
woman it seemed invidious on her part to contend
with him in his own particular sphere. But when it
was forced on me that, more often than not, man was
more ready to deride rather than worship woman, that
the special “strain” of Walter Scott’s heroes was in
Walter Scott’s delightful imagination only, and that as
a matter of fact men denied to women such lawful
honours as they might win through intellectual attainment,
and that in certain forms of their legal procedure
women were classed with “children, criminals, and lunatics,”
I began to change my opinion.</p>

<p>I thought that if the mothers of the race were to be
assorted with “criminals and lunatics,” the men they
had given birth to might be, in their toleration of such
a stigma, criminals and lunatics themselves. And
when the war broke out and all the world raised itself,
as it were, on tiptoe to see what was going to happen,
and beheld among many marvels perhaps the greatest
marvel of all—the women going forth to work in the
places of men, going in thousands, without demur or
hesitation, and taking their full share of the hardest
and most menial labour with a cheerfulness and spirit
no less remarkable than the intelligence with which
they handled difficulties hitherto unknown, it was no
longer possible to deny them equal rights with men in
every relation of life and every phase of work. By every
law of justice they deserved the vote—and I who, as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>185</span>
woman, was once against it, am bound to support the
cause. All the same I shall be sorry to see them in
Parliament; deeply sorry to find them straying so far
out of their higher and far more influential sphere. The
vanishing of modest and refined womanhood will prove
a greater loss to the nation than any other asset of its
power and renown. No woman can mingle with the
mess of political intrigue without losing something of
the charm and reticence originally in her nature, which
has inspired men to their noblest aims and ends. I
imagine that a true woman would rather be the Madonna
of a Faith than the Premier of an Empire!</p>

<p>Nevertheless I grant freely and fully that it will be
“well for England” when women have a voice in the
education of children, and when they can refuse to
“temporise” on questions of the national morality and
well-being.</p>

<p>The recent “food muddle” under the management
of men is a proof, if one were needed, of the superiority
of women in all matters of domestic management, for
any capable housekeeper would have organised the
scheme with better knowledge and finer tact. That
there will be jealousy and injustice displayed by the
stronger sex towards the weaker on this matter of
the vote, goes without saying. But jealousy and injustice
exist anyhow, and a proof of man’s inconsistency
towards women in matters of art alone is furnished by
the purchase of Lucy Kemp-Welsh’s fine picture “Forward
the guns!” in the Royal Academy, which has been
bought “<em>for the nation</em>.” Yet, mark you, though this
woman’s work is considered worthy of national keeping,
she herself may not be admitted as an R. A.! Comment
is superfluous. But it is possible that the granting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>186</span>
votes to women will alter all this, and that the barriers
which the men have carefully erected against the sex
of their mothers will be broken down for good.</p>

<p>The Jewish dispensation has to be credited for the
rule of “keeping women in their place,” along with
flocks and herds. But the Christian dispensation
teaches a lovelier lesson—for a woman was the first to
hold the God-Man in her arms, and a woman was the
first to greet Him on His resurrection from the dead.</p>

<p>Does this teach nothing? Is there no symbol of the
future of womanhood thus gloriously foreshadowed?
I venture to think there is.</p>

<p>I believe and hope that a wider freedom to woman
will mean a nobler heritage to man, and that through
her intelligence and influence he may find and prove
the “god” in him, and rise from the grave of old prejudice
to the light of more brilliant possibilities. And
this will be “well for England.”</p>

<p>Many changes are bound to come, many sorrowful
and tragic happenings are yet in store for this dear
country, but “it is well” that so these things should be,
to the end that we realise where we have missed the
way, and take heed that we stumble not again.</p>

<p>The secret of our regeneration is not in this or that
government; it is with the <em>people</em>.</p>

<p>Yet on the whole, despite clouds in our sky, it is well
for England so far. We shall come out of the darkness
if—if the <em>people</em> will it. Up to the present they have
grudged nothing—neither time, nor labour, nor money,
nor sacrifice. They have been in every sense worthy of
British tradition—a people splendid. Now it is that
they must see they do not fall a prey to “party” traps,
designed for the safeguarding of Germany in those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>187</span>
quarters where British financial interests are concerned.</p>

<p>I repeat, “All is well with England!”—all <em>will</em> be
well—if the <em>people</em> are awake and alert, if they will
unite to remove the German foe from their midst, and
if they will in time remember the old proverb which
says, “It’s no use shutting the stable door when the
horse is stolen.” The German has the fixed intention
of re-monopolising trade when the war is over, and
already our Indian Empire is in advance of us by the
ban announced against German trade in India, and
the barring of German ships from Indian ports.</p>

<p>Decisive action must be taken in these matters before
it is too late. British trade interests, British artisans,
British workers of all classes must be defended and
protected and encouraged.</p>

<p>The agricultural arts and sciences must be made a
primary matter of education for the people, and our
productive soil must be given a fair chance. Landowners
who have held thousands of acres for the
pleasure of sport alone must yield to the necessity of
feeding men instead of preserving game, and a prosperous,
smiling England, “a land flowing with milk
and honey,” will be the reward of all those who steadily
set their energies to work in the right direction, that
right direction being always for the good of the many
and not for self or the few. It should surely be the
aim of every true patriot to leave his country better
than he found it, and all personal interest should and
must go to the wall where the welfare of the people
is at all concerned. The trend of thought is all in this
one way, for which we may thank God. A renewed
faith in the highest, a return to the devotional spirit
of true religion, and a resolve to root out from every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>188</span>
educational system, from every art, from every form
of literature all that makes for evil and degradation;
this will ensure all being “well for England,” so well,
that neither the hatred, envy, nor malice of rivals can
move her from her sure foundations of peace.</p>

<p>She should be, and she <em>must</em> be great and pure, with
the greatness and pureness for which our heroes have
fought in the past, and for which they fight to-day,
and for this high cause, though we mourn our slain
manhood, we must grudge no sacrifice, however hard.
We have not grudged anything as yet—we shall never
begin to do so. And so both now and in the days to
come, through God’s mercy, may we ever be able to
<span class="locked">say—</span></p>

<p>(When the above was first issued as a booklet by the

eloquent letter from the “St. Andrews Society,” asking
me why I addressed my pamphlet to England? Where
was Scotland in my thoughts? Knowing the curious
prejudice some Scotsmen entertain for the word “England”
(which I have liked to imagine included Scotland,
Ireland, and Wales), I made haste to reply that I had
not presumed to ask “Is all well with Scotland?” as I
know all <em>must</em> be well, and that all would be for ever

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">All</span> over the world to-day looms the brooding shadow
of Death—that strange and solemn Mystery which to
most of us seems a complete Disappearance for ever
into the eternal Unknown. Though truly, if our faith
in God be perfect, we should not look upon it as a
Shadow, but a Brightness; a glorious fulfilment for
which the experiences and trials of this present life are
the needful training and preparation. Nevertheless, the
ties of human affection are strong, and partings are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>190</span>
always bitter—so that whether our beloved ones go
away from us for weeks, months, or years—whether
to a far country or to another world—it is hard to say
“good-bye!” and the sorrow of separation is the sorrow
of all the lives that are left thus lonely. The strongest
and bravest of us know well enough that those we
have lost are not really “dead,” but living elsewhere;
yet the fact that they are not actually with us—that
we cannot hear their voices or hold their hands in our
own—is sufficient to crush us down under such a burden
of grief that we feel as if we could never lift up our
eyes to heaven again or trust the great Power Invisible
which has allowed us to be deprived of all we hold
most dear. Nothing can be said in the way of consolation
that does not, at such a time, sound poor and
trivial. A great grief is of all things the most sacred:
and even the gentle words of the gentlest and most
compassionate friend hurt like a careless touch on an
open wound.</p>

<p>In this unspeakably wicked War much of our best
and bravest British manhood has been sacrificed, to say
nothing of the terrible losses suffered by our noble and
resolute Allies. Young, promising, and heroic lives
have been ruthlessly slaughtered on all the fields of
battle, and it would not be too much to say that the
whole of Europe is in mourning. It is the hour of
supreme self-sacrifice; we are called upon to give the
best of everything we have to our country, so that we
may keep it safe from the invasion of a remorseless foe,
and hold its liberty intact. Blood and treasure and
tears are the price of our freedom; we hold nothing
back. But an awful responsibility rests upon all those
who primarily brought about this most un-Christian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>191</span>
world-contest; for war and the murder of the many is
always the result of the evil thoughts and passions of a
misguided few. If Peoples in the aggregate were governed
by strong, brave, honest men who loved equity
more than their own advancement, there would be no
wars. But as yet we are still seeking for even One
strong, brave, honest man! Our national Poet speaks
truth when he tells <span class="locked">us,—</span></p>

<p>“To be honest, as this world goes, is to be one man
picked out of ten thousand.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, for the incalculable crimes of Dishonest
Governments, the Peoples are bereaved of their children—their
young manhood—and mothers, sisters, sweethearts,
wives, and little ones are flung remorselessly into
withering fires of agony, and drowned in a deep sea of
tears. Who shall comfort these poor wounded hearts?—who
shall fill these empty and desolate lives?—who
shall raise them from their swooning despair amid the
dust of graves and turn their hopes towards that Higher
Life, which though unseen and unrealised, is as certain
as what we understand to be life in this world? The
Christian Faith is, or should be, the Comforter, if accepted
in its true spiritual sense. We are too prone to
deaden and cheapen its splendid teaching by the dullness
of our own understanding: we seek to materialise
into common earthiness that which is purely heavenly.
If we trusted more absolutely in the Divine Intelligence,
through whose will and power we have come into being,
we should be entirely sure of the positive truth pronounced
by St. Paul to the <span class="locked">Corinthians:—</span></p>

<p>“There are celestial bodies and bodies terrestrial, but
the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the
terrestrial is another.... So also is the resurrection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>192</span>
of the dead; it is sown in corruption, it is raised in
incorruption; it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in
glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; it
is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body.
There is a natural body and there is a spiritual body.”</p>

<p>This is what all the scientific, theological, and psychical
instructors that ever lived in the world have been
striving to teach humanity through ages upon ages.
But we still continue to cling to the natural “body”—not
the spiritual—to the temporal, and not the eternal;
and, despite both religion and science, we surround the
episode of death with every sort of gloomy panoply and
weeping protest against the Divine decree. Yet our
men who have died at the front have died with extraordinary
cheerfulness; it would seem that some God-given
influence has surrounded them in the very midst
of all the most awful ways of dying! Never a murmur—never
a complaint—never a regret! Wonderful, and
indeed miraculous is this, if we pause to think of it!
It is as if they knew, or were being told, that there are
many things in life worse than death! They face the
Last Terror with a dauntless smile and unflinching eyes,
and it may be that they see light where many of us,
blinded by personal sorrow, are only conscious of darkness.
Our Selves are the clouds which cover the sun.</p>

<p>And while we continue to sit in the shadow and
mourn for our absent, though never lost ones, it is well
we should bear in mind that no life lived on earth,
however long extended, is complete. No lesson is ever
thoroughly learned, no accomplishment ever entirely
mastered. No poet, musician, or painter ever produced
a “perfect” work. Why? Because here we are only in
a preparatory school—wider instruction is to come.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>193</span>
The fullness of existence which is ultimately destined
to be ours is an ever-increasing perfection and power
which are at present impossible for us to conceive. Just
as when we came into this world we had no knowledge
beforehand of its natural beauties and delights, so in
the same way we cannot, in our present condition, realise
the “Shall Be” of the Hereafter. Our bodies, to which
we attach such undue importance here, are composed
entirely of particles or atoms which are constantly
changing, and none of us possess the same body we had
seven or fourteen years ago. That body has already
suffered death—not by violence, but by change. The
manner in which the change has been effected is not
perceived by ourselves, yet it has occurred. Identity
of person does not depend on the identity of these atoms;
the individual Spirit is the same, despite the shifting
forces or renewal of cells in its tenement of clay. Continuity,
persistency, and individuality are eternal laws,
and remake the vesture of the soul according to its needs.
Therefore our beloved dead are not truly dead, for, “as
we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also
bear the image of the heavenly.”</p>

<p>Many of us find it difficult—even impossible—to accept
this reasoning, and why? Because our minds are
always more or less attuned to the lower key of Self—Self,
and our own private and particular sorrow. As
long as this is the case the light will never come through
the gloom; we shall never “see God.” We shall never
understand that the lives sacrificed with such splendid
heroism, for the freedom and purification of the whole
world, have not ceased to live, and that they have simply
“passed on.” But—is not the parting from them cruel?
Ah, yes! but partings even more cruel are common in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>194</span>
the most ordinary daily life. When love grows cold—when
fair illusions perish—when the friend we trusted
is treacherous and ungrateful—when we have to “let
go” those we have most dearly cherished to other loves
and new surroundings—are not these things “cruel”?
Crueller far than death!—for death most usually clears
up many misunderstandings and sets the true soul right
with itself and with that which it has loved faithfully.
For there are many kinds of so-called “love” which is
not love at all, but merely the passion or caprice of the
moment, and which, if resolved into marriage between
the two persons concerned, ends in mutual indifference
and life-long unhappiness, and in such cases, death is
a release which separates finally and for ever. But
there is another sort of love which is so deep and
unselfish, and loyal, that it needs no earthly bond to
make it eternal, and which, no matter how long the
parting, whether by absence or death, is so truly love
in the highest sense that all the powers of earth or
heaven could not hinder its complete union with the
beloved.</p>

<p>“Shall we meet again?” sighs the bereaved mother,
the lonely wife, the despairing lover! Most assuredly
you will!—by all the known laws of attraction in this
glorious Universe you <em>must</em> meet again, if your love be
love indeed! Love is not limited by time or space; we
know that we can obtain light from a star many millions
of miles distant, and in the same way we can
give and receive love from our parted dear ones, and
can exert this power far beyond the confines of our
bodies. But only when love is really true can this
happen. For, when the veil is withdrawn from heaven
and the released Spirit goes hence, it sees and knows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>195</span>
clearly which of all its friends on earth has loved it
most unselfishly and sincerely—whose sorrow is the
most tender—whose faith is most entirely faithful! And
only shall such an one meet it again and rejoice in
everlasting union. <em>We find our own</em>: we discover our
beloved ones in that state of clear vision and life-fulfilment
to which we are all hastening. And in realising
this we shall also realise that in all the truths of
science and of reasoning there is No Death; and that
we deceive ourselves in the confusing shadow of our
personal griefs when they are strong and bitter as they
are to-day, because of our own “personal” sense of loss.</p>

<p>“It is because my beloved is gone!” is the cry—“Because
I shall see him no more!”</p>

<p>Patience! He has not “gone” far! Just into the
next room of existence, whither you yourself will soon
go; there is but the slightest partition between you!
And you will see him, as it were, directly—and you
will know him, as he will see and know <em>you!</em>—and you
will wonder why you shed so many tears when all the
while he is alive, and happy in the consciousness of
having done something in his earthly life to prepare a
cleaner, safer world for the generations coming after
him.</p>

<p>But, if this is so, some of us ask, why are we not
given the proofs of it? Why does not God make us
sure? You might as well demand why, in the former
ages of the world, the learning and science of the
present day were not revealed. “Sound-waves,” “light-rays,”
“radium,” “electric force,”—all these existed
from the very beginning of creation—<em>why were we not
told?</em> Simply because, by universal law, all advancement
is, and <em>must</em> be the result of gradual evolvement,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>196</span>
suited to the slowly expanding capacity of the human
brain and its attendant mental spirituality, and because
it is decreed that we shall “work out our own salvation.”
One thing is certain, and that is, that—<em>if</em> we knew—if
we were told the smallest part of the wondrous hidden
future awaiting us, hardly any of us would have the
resolution to live this preparatory life through! We
should all hurry ourselves out of the world, for we
would not have the patience to endure its schooling.
We could not wait. We would rush to grasp our glory;
we would not work to win it, and so we might lose
what we must ourselves deserve to gain. Hence arose
the saying, “Those whom the gods love die young.”
For their schooling has been brief and easy—“Even so,
saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labours.”</p>

<p>A striking illustration of faith in God and the future
life has been given to us in these days of darkness by
the heroic martyrdom and death of Edith Cavell, murdered
by human brutes for whom Christianity has
become a dead letter. Her resignation, and her thanks
to God for her “ten weeks’ quiet before the end”—her
unaffected devotion to the Christian Faith—her simple
“Good-bye” to her spiritual adviser with a happy smile
and her confident assurance, “We shall meet again!”
make a brilliant and inspiring contrast to the doubt and
distrust of God’s mercy openly manifested by many of
those who are bereaved and mourning in the “Valley
of the Shadow.” Prayerfully one wonders when the
inhabitants of this small planet of ours will come to
realise the fixed law of its being?—a Law which knows
no changing! Namely, that Progression towards Good—Good,
not only for one’s Self, but for Humanity—brings
peace and prosperity; while Retrogression to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>197</span>wards
Evil results in war and ruin! God Himself
cannot undo this Law, which is part of His own Eternal
Existence—it is as fixed as the poles. We dare not
blame His Almighty justice for the evil we have deliberately
brought upon ourselves. No one can deny
that all the nations now warring together have for many
years past sought to put God altogether out of their
countings, while societies and individuals, rejoicing in
prolonged good fortune and taking as their right the
blessings bestowed upon them through the mercy of a
beneficent and kindly Providence, have forgotten to
Whom they should give thanks, and have become “puffed
up,” as the Psalmist says, with pride, and enervated by
luxury. We have had innumerable warnings, but we
would not listen. We have made a jest and a mockery
of all those who sought to rouse us from our lethargy.
We have permitted such inroads of vice and atheism into
our lives and morals, our art and letters, as might make
pagans blush. The Press of the world has not occupied
itself with the uplifting of the brotherhood of the peoples,—on
the contrary, it has taken pleasure in sowing
the seeds of discontent and rebellion, and has given
prominence to the unworthy, praising the stage-mime
more than the statesman—the materialist more than the
idealist. Moreover, so far as our foe is concerned, it
has left no stone unturned that could rouse the Teuton
wolf from its lair. Bitter mockery, stinging gibe, misplaced
sneers—these have all been flung at Germany for
the past ten years or more, and, though they have been
written chiefly by half-educated young men and boys
who in the might of an ineffable conceit “rush in where
angels fear to tread,” they have had harmful effect. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>198</span>
great statesman said to me recently, “Had there been
no Press there would have been no war.”</p>

<p>This may or may not be true,—but whether true or
false the eternal verities make no mistake in their
summing-up of evil things to a fatal figure. Thoughts
give place to words, and words to actions. The War-thought
is the embryo of the War-deed. Let us not,
therefore, in the bitterness of our own personal sorrows
blame God, or demand “Where was He?” when our dear
ones have been slain. The nations have brought this
chastisement of terror upon themselves; and that the
innocent must suffer with the guilty is the worst part
of the punishment. The world was becoming sordid,
covetous, and materialistic; and now the young and
strong and brave of our best manhood are called upon
to cleanse it of its foul humours and to <em>leave it clean</em>.
Some thousands of lives must be sacrificed in this great
struggle for Freedom and for Right, but better to die
honoured than live shamed! Life, as generally lived,
is not worth the pains we take to preserve it; we do our
loved ones an infinite wrong when we assume that their
best chance of happiness is to eat and sleep and play,
and make the wherewithal to eat and sleep and play.
A brave death is more valuable than an ignoble life;
death itself being the admission to a more vital and
splendid experience.</p>

<p>This being so, we should not mourn as “those having
no hope.” We, who have loved and lost for a time, will
go on loving till we find our lost again, as we shall surely
do. We shall meet and know each other on that higher
plane where life is life indeed and love is love indeed;
and we shall make amends for all our weeping and
complaint. We shall see how slight and brief, after all,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>199</span>
were the troubles of this present, compared with the
perfect joy of the attained future. And we shall read
the Book of the Wisdom of God without mistaking one
word or letter of its meaning, and we shall learn that
Love alone is the conqueror of all kingdoms. So lift
up your weeping eyes, ye million mourners!—lift them
to the Light and Life Eternal, which shall not fail you
even in this dark Battle-Dream of Death!</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Among</span> the many “reflections” flashed upon the mirror
of the time there is one which to my mind is not so
much a “reflection” as a blur—a blot which is almost a
dark and deepening shadow. I, who venture to write of
it, own myself to be but a mere romancist, whose ostensible
business is to weave night and day, like the “Lady
of Shalott,”—“A magic web with colours gay,” a web
of thought-tapestry into scenes and episodes which may
or may not please my readers and distract them from

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">and the Shadow which darkens my outlook most is what
I may call the Shadow of Negation, or what the Roman
Church classifies among the sins against the Holy Ghost,
namely, “Presumption of God’s mercy.”</p>

<p>There are any number of apparently worthy, respect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>201</span>able
and well-intentioned persons who regard the Great
War as a singular piece of Divine injustice and undeserved
annoyance to themselves—and their attitude
towards it is so amazing as to be almost incredible.</p>

<p>They are incapable of taking a broad outlook; and,
to them, the whole terrible business is a monstrously
impertinent interference with the peaceful working of
the Parish Pump—no more.</p>

<p>This curious mental standpoint was forced upon my
notice recently by the remarks of a seemingly intelligent
man of commerce, who, having made a pleasant little
“pile” which enables him to live comfortably for the
rest of his days, and being much too old for any form
of “active” or “national” service, has, literally, nothing
to complain of, and nothing to do but offer his valueless
opinions on the terrific happenings of the hour. And he
it was, who, with an air of judicially settling the business
of the Universe, once and for all, said <span class="locked">firmly,—</span></p>

<p>“I’ve given up God! I don’t believe in a God! If
there was one He would not have permitted this war!”</p>

<p>This crushing observation from one of the least of
human microbes would not merit notice but for the
fact that many more intelligent and thoughtful microbes
than he have committed themselves to the same unwise
and, I may venture to say, blasphemous utterance. For,
if any doubter has need of assurance as to the existence
of God, this great and terrible war is the most profound,
significant, and emphatic declaration of Almighty Power
and Justice that the world has ever known.</p>

<p>It is the strong, resolved assertion of a vast spiritual
and intellectual Force, which, for many years, all the
nations now warring together have elected to ignore,
or else to acknowledge in such half-hearted fashion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>202</span>
that sheer ignoring might betoken greater reverence.
It is the Force, which by natural and immutable law
acts upon unclean and poisonous things and exterminates
them without mercy or appeal. We may call it Fate
or God as it suits us—but whatever be the accepted
name of this eternally working system of Mathematics,
it admits of no false quantities and has to be reckoned
with as the only positive FACT in the universe. All
else may change, “Heaven and earth may pass away but
My Word shall not pass away.” That is to say—“My
Word” is the eternal Law; and however craftily and
cleverly we may arrange our little “civilisations” and
schemes of “giving” in order to “get,” we cannot carry
forward a single act of injustice or falsity without punishment
following the offence. If not soon, then late.
<em>Our</em> judgments, <em>our</em> opinions on the scroll of everlasting
equity, are as the scrawls of babes who are incapable of
mastering the fact that two and two make four. We are
always trying to make them five, the one over being a
clumsy attempt to gain some advantage to ourselves.</p>

<p>It is our “camouflage”—that vulgar expression of
French police “argot” which truly is not in the French
language at all, but which, nevertheless, has lately become
the stupid parrot-cry of the irremediably illiterate
British press, whose paragraphists seize with rabid joy
on any foreign word they do not entirely understand and
run it to death.</p>

<p>Yet, try as we may, two and two will <em>not</em> make five.
Hence our small political quarrels and big greedy wars.</p>

<p>The <em>pros</em> and <em>cons</em> of the present terrific clash of
nations can be totalled up as easily as a sum on a slate—each
effect has had its causes. Belgium is devastated,
and her people have been and are robbed, tortured, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>203</span>
murdered. True! But what of Belgium’s own tacitly
approved cruelties on the Congo? The present is the
result of the past. Consider Russia! She is like a
great creature fallen in the dust—the seeming corpse of
herself, helpless to move, while birds of prey gather
round her seeking to tear her to bits and divide the
spoil. But does not Russia deserve her fate?—has she
not invited it? May we not think of her cruelties,
tyrannies, and enslavements practised on her own people
for hundreds of years? The gods have been patient
with her arrogance, but there is a limit even to divine
patience. Italy and France—prosperous, and growing
more and more fond of money-getting, eager to destroy
all their noble, ancient ideals—these have, as it were,
administered a kick to the very thought of Deity.</p>

<p>Twenty years ago in France the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Catechisme du Libre
Pensuer</i> was taught in schools, and the name of God
excluded from the general curriculum. Italy has long
been openly pagan, notwithstanding the “Holy Prisoner”
of the Vatican. And Germany, our brutal foe,
has flung every ideal to the winds save Self and Greed,
so that not even the “untutored savage” principles of
honour have any hold on her.</p>

<p>And what may we, what <em>dare</em> we say of Great Britain?
Is it a <em>true</em> religion that to suit convention prints
a prayer to God in a rag newspaper, when for years that
same newspaper has ignored every sign, symbol, or suggestion
of religious faith? Rightly or wrongly, British
folk are credited with more “camouflage” than all the
French police put together; “camouflage” in this instance
standing for hypocrisy, and if they do believe in
a God it is difficult to realise their sincerity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the old thunder rolls from Heaven—“God<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>204</span>
is not mocked!” and, so far from seeing His “injustice”
in this terrible war which is ruining so much that can
never be replaced, let us realise that we, the offending
Nations, have brought it upon Ourselves.</p>

<p>Ourselves have been ungrateful for His mercies and
blessings; Ourselves have made Self our god, and
Wealth our chief aim—and so now by the Divine Law
shall Our Selves be slain and our wealth taken from us.
Thus the Shadow darkens the mirror of my “reflections”—for
I feel with Admiral Beatty that (as he expressed
it) “until religious revival takes place at home just so
long will the war continue. When England can look
out on the future with humbler eyes and a prayer on
her lips, then we can begin to count the days towards the
end!”</p>

<p>Then—and only then! Then the Shadow will lift
and the mirror will reflect the glorious figure of
Victory....</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_26">TRIUMPH OF WOMANHOOD<br />

<span class="subhead">(<i>Written for the Scottish Women’s Hospital</i>)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">As</span> a light in deep darkness she has arisen—woman,
pure womanly, with all the God-given attributes of her
highest nature at last acknowledged by her self-styled
“lord and master,” Man! She has shaken off the trammels
which for many centuries he had fastened about
her—as heroic maid and mother she has roused the better
spirit in him. Out of the gloom and blood and
slaughter of this world war—the most wicked war that
ever devastated the earth—she has radiated upon him
like an angel, clothed in a glory of love and pity; and,
moving by his side through the poisonous smoke of
battle and the thunder of the guns, she has cheered him
on his way. When wounded and fallen she has been
swift to rescue him, and first to soothe. Who will, who
<em>can</em>, ever justly estimate the saving work of women in
this terrific holocaust of nations!—this mad hurtling of
man against brother—man without thought for the
consequences of such wholesale murder! To Woman,
in her mother-love and mercy, friend and foe are alike
indifferent; all that her pitying eyes see are the gaping
wounds, the flowing blood, the torn and disfigured limbs—her
province is to save, heal, and comfort if she can.
She knows that with God there are no nations, but that
all men are human beings, subject to the same sufferings,
the same deaths; she knows by the teaching of Christ<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>206</span>
that not a sparrow shall fall to the ground without Our
Father, and that men are of “more value than many
sparrows.” So, placing herself in tenderest unison
with that “quality of mercy” which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“Is not strained,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But droppeth, like the gentle rain from heaven,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Upon the place beneath,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">she gives her care and service to all. She has no fears
for herself; she would as soon die as live, provided only
she is doing her duty. Perhaps, away down in the very
core of her heart, her natural maternal instinct teaches
her that these struggling, contesting masses of men are
more or less enraged children, tormented and driven by
bigger boys than themselves to fall upon each other and
slay without thought—she may sometimes think wistfully
that had they sought her counsel they might have
found some better way out of their quarrel than the
killing of their brothers—but, until lately, her rôle
through all the centuries has been the mistaken one of
submission to man’s caprice or ordainment, and any
attempt at individuality on her part has been decried
as a perversion of sex. Now the question of sex, reduced
to first principles, appears to be that woman
should find her sole content as the “vessel” of man’s
pleasure—the breeder and nurse of his offspring and
no more. This great war has somewhat altered the lines
of the masculine perspective, for men have been forced
to admit that women can do all their work as well as
themselves, and sometimes better. They can even build
ships and aeroplanes, and all this without losing the
spirit of womanliness. Strange as it may seem, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>207</span>
woman who might lately have been seen hammering
at the keel of a “Dreadnought” can prove herself soft-handed
in tending the wounded, and most reverently
loving in her last cares for the dying and the dead.
She has mastered her nerves—those “Early Victorian”
nerves which shuddered fastidiously at the sight of
blood, and sent their hysterical owners into a swoon
when dangers or difficulties arose, in order to create
fresh confusion; she knows the great secret of self-control,
and the wonderful vigour and courage which
are born of that fine quality. There are very few
women nowadays who scream at the sight of a mouse!
But this was considered quite “the proper thing” to do
in Jane Austen days, just as in some of the queer old
novels written before the grand romances of Sir Walter
Scott, the heroines invariably “fainted away” when the
lover of the piece declared his passion. Women know
that “lover of the piece” fairly well by this time, and
all his limitations—sufficiently, at any rate, to be convinced
that there is nothing in him worth even a pretended
“swoon,” though there may be much that <em>is</em>
worth cherishing, guiding, and inspiring to the best
purposes. Not every man is like a certain one I wot
of, who, after being nursed for three months in a
friend’s house, said to that friend and hostess on the
day he left in restored health,—“If you want a man to
like you, never do anything for him!” This was not
said in jest, but in grim and churlish earnest. It was a
curious recompense for three months’ watchful anxiety
and care, but I dare say she realised then, if never
before, that “one cannot make a silk purse out of a
sow’s ear.” Fortunately there are few such “sow’s
ears” about; most men, especially our heroic fighters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>208</span>
are touchingly grateful for women’s kindness and devoted
nursing, while fairly astonished at their endurance,
cheerfulness, patience, and devotion. Truly, the
supposed “incapacities” of woman never existed except
in the hopelessly unintelligent of her sex which have
their counterpart in man; she has supported her share
of the burden of life under a stupid system of repression
and tyranny which has frequently resulted in discouragement,
weariness, and indifference. But give her
the chance to be her true, free self, and she will be the
most powerful factor in the world for the betterment
of humanity. We shall not deny that there are worthless
women—fool-women, toy-women,—fit for nothing
but posturing in various attitudes and sets of clothing;
but these will find their level and grow fewer as time
goes on. The grander, purer natures will, like waves of
a clean, bright sea, roll over the mud-banks and eventually
wash worthless things away. For now, after centuries
of oppression and servitude, in which her incalculable
love has been more than half wasted, and her
splendid qualities misprized, now at last Woman has
her chance! And those who see her day dawning must
and will pray earnestly that she will use her powers
always for the highest and the best, to the end that Man
may find in her not a “drag on the wheel,” but a great
lifting strength to bear him upward and onward to that
completeness of noble living which from the beginning
God has ordained.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_27">IN PRAISE OF ENEMIES<br />

<span class="subhead">(<i>Published in the “Sunday Times”</i>)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> are not always thankful for our blessings; often,
indeed, we do not recognise them as such. They come
to us disguised in the fashion of curses, or so we are
apt to consider them till we know better. Many of us
are absurdly proud of the number of our friends; with
equal absurdity we deplore our evil destiny if we have
but one enemy. Yet if all the truth were known, we
should find that we have more reason to thank God
for our foes than for our friends!</p>

<p>In the actual storm and stress of life’s battle our
“friends,” so-called, are of little use to us; they are
more prone to be a drag on the wheel. They are,
generally speaking, kind, conventional folk, who, when a
soul is girding on its armour for action, will give
“advice,” such as “Oh, I wouldn’t run any risks, if I
were you!” or “Do be careful not to offend any one!”
or “You’ll get yourself disliked!” as if risk, offence,
dislike, and trouble were not full of stimulus, inspiring
the fighting spirit which alone can beat down difficulties
and carry us on from triumph to triumph till the great
victory over ourselves be assured! But enemies!
Praise God for them! They are the useful and necessary
Force which hurls itself against all progress, all
power and originality of thought or action—the murderous
obstacle laid across the line in an attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>210</span>
wreck the express train—the great contrary wind that
seeks to drive the sailing boat against the rocks—the
“thing in the way” that must be thrust aside and
trampled underfoot. What worker or warrior would
willingly forego “each rebuff that makes earth’s
smoothness rough”? The man or woman without an
enemy must be of all persons the most insignificant; one
who <em>does</em> nothing and <em>is</em> nothing; of whom no one is
envious, and who can never have said a brave, original
thing, or a word of upright, downright truth in any
circumstances.</p>

<p>You never know how high you are climbing till you
feel some one behind you trying to pull you down.
Perhaps the greatest compliment that can be paid by
ignorance and malice to a man or woman of genius and
virtue, is the verdict passed on the Divine Master in
Galilee, that he (or she) “hath a devil”!</p>

<p>At the present time more than at any other period
of history we of the British Empire should bless God
for our enemies! What they have done and what they
are doing for us, albeit unconsciously and unwillingly,
can hardly be accurately estimated—not while they are
still attacking us. We must wait some years before we
can measure up the advantages they are bestowing
upon us—advantages which we might not in a century
have obtained for ourselves.</p>

<p>We were too satisfied with our apparent “friends”;
we were, and still are, much too sure of them! We
were comfortable, contented, lazy. We had everything
we wanted and more. We spent money freely, and
being eminently good-natured and trustful, we allowed
every one to come in at our open doors and partake of
our hospitality. Out of our full bags of gold we poured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>211</span>
rivers of charity in every direction; we helped everybody
that asked for help; and we allowed all sorts of
folk to exploit us and make money out of us. We could
not believe that the “friends” we entertained and whose
hands we had filled with good gifts could ever turn
upon us. We seemed to have no foes; and we trusted
these “friends” of ours implicitly. Too casual and easy-going
to heed the teachings of philosophy we forgot that
it takes a far nobler nature to receive benefits than to
bestow them.</p>

<p>Mean minds resent generosity while taking advantage
of it, and nothing goads and envenoms some dispositions
so much as the near consciousness of a superior
force and ungrudging hand. This was, and is, the
trouble with the Kaiser and his particular following—we
will not say Germany, for German without the
Hohenzollern autocracy would be a very different and
far greater Germany than it has been since the days of
Goethe and Schiller.</p>

<p>The Emperor William, as an eminently theatrical
monarch, loving grease-paint and the limelight, and
obsessed by various crazes, such as hate for his English
mother and intensified hate for his mother’s country,
filled even with a morbid revulsion against the English
blood in his own veins, cannot abide the thought of
the greatness and far-reaching protective influence of
the British Imperial Power. To bend, break, and destroy
<span class="allsmcap">THAT</span> has been his dream from boyhood—a dream
never to be fulfilled! His visits to our shores were the
visits of a seeming “friend,” and we treated him as an
honest people treat an honest man. He took our
kindness for stupidity, our trust for ignorance, our faith
for credulity, and his complete misconception of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>212</span>
British character has led him into a trap which he set
for us, but by which he himself is snared—the usual
Nature-law enacted surely and remorselessly on every
treacherous soul.</p>

<p>What would be said or thought of a man invited to
the house of a kindly hostess and permitted to enjoy
the full freedom of the place, its hospitality, its food,
its comfort and shelter, who, on having used it as a
convenience and gained personal pleasure and advantage
therein, even to the making of money, suddenly turned
roughly upon his entertainer, abused her manners, her
voice, her speech, her friends, her servants and mode of
living, and having got all he wanted out of her personally
insulted her? Probably not one man in ten thousand
would conduct himself so vilely, but if that one man
did so forgo all manliness, there would be not a few
of his own sex ready and more than willing to put him
in his place at the point of the boot.</p>

<p>Yet such has been the “honorable code of chivalry”
of the Emperor William—the “Kultur” which boasts
of treachery to his own kindred, of injury to his mother’s
native land, of wantonly murderous attacks on innocent
civilians who are not in any way concerned with the
diseased obsessions of his brain—a “Kultur” which is
more than anything else the “cult of stupidity”—the
stupidity of a blinded bull charging into everything
with unreasoning fury. But for us the bull-onslaught is
a saving grace, for through the blindness of the beast we
see!</p>

<p>Yes, we see, and see clearly! We have discovered
our foe behind the disguise of our “friend,” and instead
of opening our doors to him we shut them. Instead of
holding out the hand of welcome and confidence we put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>213</span>
up the curtain of our artillery fire!—and the valour
of Britain, wrongfully supposed to be asleep or dead, is
up in all its pristine might and mettle, full-armed with
a strength and magnificent courage unmatched in all
our history.</p>

<p>This is what our enemies have done for us: they have
brought us to realise the truth Ourselves! Had it not
been for their “stab-i’-the-back” we might still have
played away our time, and with it our commerce. Our
enemies have roused our grip and grit; they have taught
us that we can turn out as many fighting men and
munitions in twelve months as they could do in forty
years. Even we, accustomed for a century to a peace
unbroken save by small foreign skirmishes, are now
with our Allies winning the greatest war of the world.</p>

<p>Assaulted in new and brutal ways from the air, from
the underseas, as well as on land, Imperial Britain
holds her own, for which she may thank, not her friends,
but her foes. True it is that, as Christ taught, “A
man’s foes shall be they of his own household,” and this
saying is markedly fulfilled in the Kaiser’s hatred of
his mother’s country and people. But whether of one’s
own household or not, nothing is so salutary, so rousing,
so inspiring and vivifying to the mind as the consciousness
of enemies, the knowledge that some one envies you,
grudges you success, and would be glad to hear of your
failure in some great effort. It rouses all your latent
forces and makes you stronger, bolder, more irresistible
than ever you were before.</p>

<p>A fair woman never looks fairer than when she is
being “picked to pieces” by a yellow-skinned scandal-monger,
and to any individual possessing gifts above the
ordinary the spite and malice of the envious and jealous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>214</span>
are as light on the path and music in the air, invigorating
the heart, bracing the energies, and emphasising
the fact that any one so envied is <em>worth</em> envying,
any one so hated is <em>worth</em> hating, because so far above
the reach of either envy or hatred!</p>

<p>So let us praise God for our enemies! They are
adding to our triumphs and renewing our glories. When
we chant the “Te Deum” let us mentally include an
extra strophe which shall say, “We bless Thee, O Lord,
for our foes, that Thou dost suffer them to teach us the
sure way to victory! We thank Thee for their broken
faith, their cruelties, and their falsehoods, as from these
we renew our own resolve to keep our promised word
to all nations, and even in the bitterness of battle to
be honest and humane!</p>

<p>“From their unjust cause we draw fresh justice:
from their defeats we derive our conquest. Without
them we might have forgotten what we <em>were</em> and what
we <em>are</em>! We thank and praise Thee, O God, that through
these our enemies we have found our best friends—<span class="smcap">Ourselves</span>!”</p>

</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">In</span> the De Montfort Hall, Leicester, at the conclusion
of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Lecture on the Great
War, Miss Marie Corelli, who presided as Chairman,
made an appeal for recruits in the following <span class="locked">terms:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is very little for me or for any one to say,
after what we have heard to-night. The moving and
magnificent panorama which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
has brought before our eyes by the force of his eloquence
should inspire us more to deeds than words. He has
told us what our men have already done; he has
hinted at what they have yet to do. This fearful
war is not a game at football; we cannot play at it, or
put it aside as something to be thought of casually after
we have consulted our own humour and convenience.
It is a time of self-sacrifice; we owe the best of all
we have to our country. We must give, not only ourselves,
but those we love to the country’s service. In
these fortunate islands, mercifully protected by the sea,
we have not as yet experienced the horrors of invasion;
but invasion <em>may</em> come, and <em>will</em> come if we are not
prepared, alert, and watchful! We must grudge nothing
to prevent such disaster. We must put aside our own
concerns entirely, and think of what this Great War
means. It means wider freedom for the whole world!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>216</span>
It means an end to the tyranny and savagery of Prussian
militarism; it means greater progress and broader
civilisation. And being such a war, every man should
be proud and eager to bear his part in it. Any man,
physically “fit” who hesitates or hangs back at such
a crucial moment in his country’s hour of trial is a
coward! And any woman who holds him back is also
a coward, and a selfish one! We love our men—yes!—but
love is not true love if it hinders a man from
doing his duty. There is danger—there is chance of
death on the field of battle; but death comes to all
of us sooner or later; and we may question whether
it is not better to pass away gloriously with honour,
than to creep languidly out of existence in bed, surrounded
by physic bottles. A soldier must face all
possibilities, and a brave man must be willing to risk
the worst for the chance of winning the best. As
Shakespeare tells <span class="locked">us,—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentqq">“‘Cowards die many times before their deaths;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The valiant only taste of death but once.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“There is urgent necessity for every able man (who is
not employed in turning out munitions of war) to join
the colours—and if he is a man at all, he should have
no hesitation. After such a moving history as that
told us by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is there a ‘fit’
man here who is not willing and eager to join his
brothers-in-arms, and do his best to make their task
easier? Is there a man whose work lies, not abroad,
but at home in the making of shells and ammunition,
that would grudge a single hour of labour for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>217</span>
country in such urgent need? If there is, he must be
of bad blood and not a true-born Briton!</p>

<p>“If I had the right, the eloquence or the power to
plead with you, I would ask every man here present
who can join the colours, but who has not done so, to
do it now! And I would also ask every man whose
skill and strength are needed for the manufacture of
war material, to work steadily, cheerfully, and ungrudgingly,
in the full consciousness that by urging
on the necessary output he is helping to save hundreds
of the lives of his countrymen. He, the worker, is as
necessary to the Empire as the soldier; he also is
fighting the King’s enemies.</p>

<p>“And, if I had any force to persuade, I would pray
every woman in this audience to prove her love for the
men belonging to her by inspiring them to do their
duty to ‘King and country’; either by sending them
away to join the Army, with all good blessing and trust
in God for their safety—or by ‘heartening’ them up
to their work in war munitions, and putting no difficulties
in their path of honour. For every man that
hangs back from military service, or ‘shirks’ his work
refuses to help his brothers; and every woman that
keeps a man away from the great fight, or encourages
him to grudge and shorten his hours of labour is wronging
other women’s husband and sons. In this great
test of national character none of us must fail. In the
war, as in work, we must all pull together, shoulder to
shoulder to win the victory which must and shall be
<span class="locked">ours—</span></p>

“‘If England to herself do rest but true!’”
</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>218</span></p>

<p>The speaker concluded by asking her hearers to join
in a hearty vote of thanks to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle
for his “fine, instructive, and impressive lecture.” This
proposal was seconded by the Mayor of Leicester
(Alderman J. North) and Sir Samuel Faire, and carried
with acclamation, the vast audience being evidently
moved to exceptional enthusiasm.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The one true seed of Freedom! This is deeply
implanted in our Empire, and you Canadian boys are
fostering it and helping it to grow. Your help is needed
in peace as much as in war; we want your strength,
youth, and resolution as a firm bulwark against internal
discords and mischievous disloyalty. It is as brave
a thing to face and overcome the Evil Spirit at home as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>220</span>
it is to face him in the field, and showers of fiery
shrapnel are less disintegrating than the showers of
personal malice and intrigue directed only too often
against the men to whom we owe the amazing and
almost miraculously sudden downfall and humiliation of
our enemies in the greatest war of history.</p>

<p>You Canadians have strongly helped to bring this
downfall and humiliation to pass; like a fine family of
stalwart sons, you have formed a guard of honour round
your Motherland, and defended her from the hands of
the spoilers. All honour to you! We want you to
know and to believe that we are grateful, and that we
shall never forget your dauntless daring and heroism!
Ingratitude is the commonest and yet the deadliest of
sins—ingratitude to God in the first place, and, in the
second, ingratitude to the men whom God has given us
to be our saviours. The first part of the indictment is
a matter for each private and individual conscience; it
is for every man and woman to try and visualise the
devastation and misery which have been mercifully
spared to the uninvaded British Isles, and to decide
whether his or her thanksgiving is real, and deeply felt.
The second part concerns the whole people of Great
Britain and her Overseas Dominions—whether they, in
very truth and earnest, sufficiently realise what they
owe to the sorely-tried military and naval leaders upon
whose shoulders has fallen the gigantic responsibility
of conducting the war to a victorious issue. <em>Not</em> to
realise it is to be guilty of a mental crime so monstrous
as to be almost unimaginable. And yet, the moment
political pawns are set on the chess-broad, every claim
to integrity and patriotism is questioned and argued
from the base point of view of “personal interest.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>221</span>
Personal interest is a powerful motive force with most
men, but it does not count with heroes like Sir Douglas
Haig, Admiral Beatty, or Marshal Foch. Think of
these men! for it is <em>they</em> who won the war—<em>they</em>, who
through God, have given us the victory! Not the
talkers, but the doers; not the politicians, but the
fighters, among whom you, brave Canadians, held your
part like the heroes of an epic. You are rough, perchance,
but you are ready! Some there are who say
you have not received half your rightful share of honour
in this country; if this <em>is</em> so, then your Motherland is
indeed unworthy of your prowess! But I hardly think
this is, or can be so. You do not get the true voice
of the British People in the British Press—always
remember that! The People know their best men,
and honour them accordingly. And if, by chance, they
are misled occasionally, and those leaders whom they
have believed their “best” prove false to the trust placed
in them, none so swift, sure, and deadly as the British
People to rend them for their broken word. They
know you, Canadians, as their blood-brothers; and as
such will resent any wrong inflicted on your liberties
and commerce. They applaud your patriotism and rejoice
in your courage; you are the younger sons of
the Empire, and in the name of one Throne, one Flag,
we salute you and give you our heart’s gratitude!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>223</span></p>
<p>How often we have seen such shells as these!—and
how little have we associated the familiar name of
“shell” with any thought of war or “shock” or bloodshed!
Holding a sea-shell close against our ears we
listen in fancy to the solemn music of the ocean surging
through its hollow cavity,—the ocean with its sweeping
thunderous harmony,—though all the time we know it
is but the sound of our own life-blood pouring through
our veins and pulsing upon our senses. And now, when
we talk of “shells,” we mean something vastly different
to the “small and pure as a pearl” object which moved
a great Poet to song—for the “pure” thing was the
work of God, and “a miracle of design” wrought to
suit the needs of the “little living will that made it
stir on the shore”; but the “shells” <em>we</em> have to do with
are man’s work, made to destroy all living wills that
come in contact with them! In their terrific way they
too are “miracles of design,” for their cavities hold
death and scatter it broadcast. Still more wonderful
it is to realise the fact that women’s hands have been
taught and trained to prepare this flying death—women’s
hands, surely formed by nature for tenderness
and caressing, for soothing and consoling! How, then,
has it chanced that they should adapt themselves to
such dire uses? Why do they labour so strenuously
and eagerly to make weapons for the armoury of the
King of Terrors? Women’s hands! What charming
and poetic things have been said and written about
them! Think of the hands in Fra Angelico’s picture
of the “Angel of the Annunciation” where the dainty
tapering fingers are as exquisitely delicate as the buds
of the lilies they hold! Or, recall the subtle beauty of
Heine’s description of the hand of an unknown lady,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>224</span>
resting white and beautiful on the carved edge of a
confessional in a dark cathedral aisle, the owner of the
hand being too enshrouded in shadows to be visible.</p>

<p>“So still and pure was that lovely hand,” wrote the
poet, “that whatever sins its mistress might be admitting
to her confessor, it was evident that of itself it had
nothing to do with sin or folly. It was a stainless sweetness
alone and apart, and shone in the gloom of the vast
cathedral like a sculptured ivory emblem of innocence.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless!—women’s hands that are, or that
might be, as delicate and caressable as those of Fra
Angelico’s model, or Heine’s unseen lady, are now at
work in the strangest kind of “annunciation”!—the
most amazing form of “confession”! Why do they toil
in such a contrary fashion to their natural bent and
inclination? The answer is swift and conclusive. Because
Evil is let loose on the earth, and because Good
must use all force to overcome it. And, out of sternest
necessity, Good must arm itself with weapons that shall
not only match but surpass those employed by Evil.
In a fight against devils, angels must join battle. In
some of the most magnificent scenes of Milton’s “Paradise
Lost” when war rages between the warriors of
God and the followers of Satan, the good are described
as fighting against the bad with terrific weapons of
attack, and the outbursts of fire hurled against the
devilish foe were none the less potent because wrought
by the angelic hosts. Our women workers who prepare
the munitions of war are one and all inspired by the
same fixed motive and desire—namely, to end the sorrows
and suspense of the suffering nations who are
involved in the disastrous upheaval which is the result
of a people’s pitiful belief in the “divine right,” of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>225</span>
crowned madman. And as they turn out “shells” and
yet more “shells,” we know that they hope and believe
that for every one completed, at least one of the fiendish
murderers of the innocent may be dismissed from a
world which his presence has darkened. Perchance
they may, as they press on with their work, hear more
mystic sounds than are conveyed in the cavity of an
empty shell “void of a living will” on the sea-shore—for
their filled shell speaks of their own blood, burning
with grief and indignation at the slaughter of their
kindred—and of the roar and thunder of the guns instead
of the crashing billows of the sea. Who shall
count the throbbing thoughts of the women who fill these
“shells”?—women who look calm enough and resolute
enough, and who work on tirelessly and almost wordlessly,
as though moved by a single heart, beating
through each one’s separate labour! A visitor to a shell
factory in the Midlands said to me,—“They work
quite mechanically; I think they hardly know what
they are about.” <em>Don’t</em> they know what they are about?
Indeed they do! They know they are making weapons
of destruction that shall bring reprisals for the deaths
of brave men—they know that they are helping to save
the lives of their own kinsmen, and with all their
strength they “speed up,” because they feel that by
so doing they are pushing on the end of the war. We
shall never be able to realise how much they have
done for us, and alas!—the ingratitude of nations to
its workers is proverbial. It takes a woman to understand
woman’s enforced labour, and to enter with sympathy
into all she loses by taking the place of man in
hard and difficult times—what sacrifices in health and
vitality she makes by long hours of steady application<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>226</span>
to monotonous factory work—what temptations she has
to resist—what bribes—yes!—bribes of cash and comfort
she has to forgo. For the enemy is busy elsewhere
than on the field—insidious and indefatigable in stirring
up strife in this country and sowing the seeds of disloyalty
and discontent, and it says much for our women
that they are awake and alert to the fact. Of the
contemptible few who “make love” to “Fritz” in his
prison camp, one can only be sorry that they are so
“weak in the upper story!” The real women of the
Empire—the women who, in the after-war days that
are coming, will have so much of the country’s destiny
in their guidance, are in the majority sound, sane, and
loyal—we can trust them with work even more momentous
than the making of shells! Meanwhile, we can try
to be grateful to them for their steadiness and perserverance,
their pluck and patience, and let us not forget
at any time what we owe to them. It should be graven
deep on the records of the nation that—<em>Without
Women’s Work the War Could Not Be Won!</em> And in
the hour of victory let us not fail to pay them our debt
of Honour!</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">You</span>, whose eyes are able to read these tragic lines of
blind John Milton, can you realise what they mean?
Do you feel to the innermost core of your heart the
blackness of that “eclipse without all hope of day,”
which like a never-lifting cloud envelopes those from
whom the blessing of sight has been taken for ever!
Can you, even by the utmost exertion of your imagination,
truly grasp what it would mean to you if all
light and colour were blotted out from your consciousness,
and you had to rely on a merciful guiding hand
to lead you to and fro, to hold you lest you stumbled,
and conduct you from places of business or pleasure
safely back to your home? If you could not see beloved
faces?—if the sunlight could never again reach those
poor closed channels of the vision you once enjoyed?—if
the skies, the lovely country, the woods and the
ocean were all glories that should never again gladden
your sight?—if this were so, would you not pray to
God that being thus handicapped He would at least
give you <em>friends</em>? Friends who would be eyes to you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>228</span>
hands to you—who would cheer you in dreadful
moments of depression blacker than blindness, and who
would help you to find occupation and train you to do
useful work, although sightless, so that the days and
years should not be so fraught with monotony and dull
regret; and that life, after all, should not seem a
barren and empty thing?</p>

<p>You have heard of St. Dunstan’s Hostel for soldiers
and sailors blinded in the war? It is now one of earth’s
“Holy Places”—holy because the benediction of heaven
has made it a sanctuary—a sanctuary of love, patience,
self-sacrifice and untiring devotion—holy, because the
patiently endured martyrdom of a brave man has been
and is its spiritual foundation. Sir Arthur Pearson—(some
of you do not know it or think of it)—is himself
blind. And what makes his sorrow darker for him,
is that he has known all the blessings of perfect sight—he
has enjoyed all the activities of an eager and
vigorous life, and is still in the prime of manhood.
“How sad for him!” murmurs the conventional Society
voice—“Such a drawback!” Yes, how sad!—but what
gladness for others he gathers from his own handicap!—what
splendid results have sprung from his “drawback!”—what
sunshine pours from the cloud of his
night! The American essayist, Emerson, in advising
one stricken with adversity, writes, “Be like the wounded
oyster, <em>mend your shell with a pearl</em>!” With what a
pearl of great price has Arthur Pearson mended his
life’s wound! Knowing the bitterness of blindness, he
has devoted all his energies to the care of the blind
and to the lightening of their darkness, especially to
those heroes who, in the very hey-day of their youth
and manliness have gone unhesitatingly forth to face<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>229</span>
the foe in this wickedest of wars, and have been blinded
by shot and shell explosions, losing all sense of vision
in one cruel moment—a moment that rings down the
curtain on all scenes and faces for ever! Shall we not,
with all our hearts, help the sublime cause of “love to
our neighbours,” and consolation to our self-sacrificing
soldiers and sailors, taught to us by the example of
this Englishman who does not protest, but <em>lives</em> his
Christian faith in a manner that Christ must surely
approve? It would be trespassing on sacred ground to
presume to guess how much heavenly light has been
mystically shed on his own darkness by this noble
dedication of his sorrow to noblest ends. But it may
be reverently said that he has followed as far as is
humanly possible the Divine Teacher who, in healing
a blind man, “put His hands upon his eyes and <em>made
him look up</em>.” In this we can all help. We can make
our brave, blind friends, the soldiers and sailors,
rendered sightless for our sakes, “look up!” We can
make them feel they are not alone and helpless in a
dark world; we can convince them that their welfare
is dear to us, and that we are fully conscious of the
immense sacrifices they have made for us and for the
country. Let us all then do our utmost and best for
St. Dunstan’s and strengthen the hands of its Founder,
and let it never be said that we were guilty of the
meanest vice known to humanity—Ingratitude!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_32">SWEEPING THE COUNTRY</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">They</span> say it does; and I hardly wonder! The broom
is so long and searchful; it goes into so many holes
and corners that surely not a single spider’s web is
left unvisited. It gathers up the pale dust of British
gullability with an admirable adroitness, and what
is perhaps the best thing about it is that it pays for
its sweepings. Not every broom does that! But I
am told—I do not assert it or vouch for it—that it is a
German broom; and no make of broom in all the
world is more capable of industry or more resistless to
wear and tear. Opposed as we are, and as we must
be, to German militarism, German labour will, I fear,
be always ahead of us, especially if the German worker
puts in eight or ten hours where the British decides
to give only four or six. This is a matter for future
testing; in the meanwhile let us consider with attention,
in capital letters “THIS MORNING’S NEWS
ABOUT PELMANISM,” as it appears in that esteemed
journal <i>The Sunday Times</i>, to which I have had the
honour to contribute. It is but the other day that
I was assured “on the highest authority” (as the
bewildered press reporters at the Peace Conference
have expressed it) that “Pelman” was originally spelt
“<em>Poehlmann</em>,” and that at discreet intervals his “Magic
Card” would be followed by another, inscribed “<em>Roth</em>.”
Both names have the euphonious Teuton ring about
them, and they both imply Money—money spent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>231</span>
lavishly and magnificently on the “flowing tide of
Pelmanism” by way of opulent and ceaseless advertisement
in all the newspapers which joyously yield their
columns to cash rather than to intelligent information,
and give up whole pages to “Pelman” or “Roth” indiscriminately,
in competition with a kindly Swedish
masseur or exercise-man, who in equally lavish announcements
and large type, promises health to the
healthless even as “Pelman” and “Roth” promise brain
to the brainless. Of “Roth” I know little except that
according to advertisement “he is a remarkable man”
(of which I am entirely convinced), but of “Pelman”
I have learned something at first hand. I have learned,
for instance, how it is that the spacious, tremendous,
profuse, and overpowering advertisements of this system
of brain-forcing flood every corner of the press, squeezing
out by their size and the space they occupy legitimate
news of interest to the public; of course, the first
and chief reason is that they are paid for. Everything
in every line of business, pleasure or social
position, is paid for; even the clergyman who professes
to show you the way to heaven is paid for. Then
surely it follows that Pelman or Poehlmann must be
a multi-millionaire? No! he need not be. As the
controller of the “flowing tide” he may make others
pay, and so may command cash without being personally
wealthy. He no doubt realises the truth of what
a certain frank proprietor of pickles assured me—“If
advertising is done well and continuously it brings
in double and treble the money it costs.” And the
channels in which the “flowing tide” is set to run are
cleverly prepared and delved out in the shifting sands
of British innocence and credulity—two admirable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>232</span>
traits of our national character. It is a touching thing
to realise that the guileless Briton should so simply
confess himself to “Pelman” as mindless and memory-less—and
it is equally pathetic to discover in the
“Census” of “Pelmanists” there can be counted one
barmaid, one bacon-curer, and one “corporation official”!
“Art and music and literature are being re-born,” says
Pelman—and no doubt the Pelmanists are already in
travail. It is all very clever and amusing; a little
comedy in which the guileless Briton is the bear that
dances to the Pelman pipings. I admire cleverness
wherever I find it; it is a star in the general murk of
stupidity, and I am the last person in the world to
depreciate the brilliancy of its glitter. But it has
interested me to study the movements of this particular
scheme, and chance or fortune placed one or two threads
in my hands which seemed to suggest a clue. Briefly
then, I was offered Fifty Guineas to “write up”
Pelmanism. The offer came through a very agreeable
and enterprising journalist, employed, I presume, to
secure fresh supplies for the “flowing tide,” and he
added to his own personal and friendly entreaties a considerable
quantity of literary matter setting forth the
miraculous improvement in heretofore dull brains under
the influence of Pelman or Poehlmann. I made a
careful study of these documents, and the first thing
that dawned on my own dim intelligence was that
every would-be student of the “course” would be called
upon to pay six guineas, either in one sum or by “easy
instalments,” though one <em>can</em> have a copy of the book
entitled <i>Mind and Memory</i> (which tell “all about”
Pelmanism but does not instruct) <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">gratis</i>, and in that
book are “particulars” showing how one can obtain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>233</span>
the “course” at a reduced fee. Thanks to my journalist
friend I had the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">gratis</i> book (in its forty-fourth edition,
and for this reason called “The World’s Most Widely
Read Book”—well! with all diffidence allow me to hint
that this is incorrect, as I myself am the author of
one or two books in their fifty-first editions), but the
“Course” did not tempt me to disburse guineas, not
even had I accepted the Fifty offered. (I may say
here that I never accept “tips.”) But I could not, and
cannot refrain from considering how, if the scheme
works successfully, as of course it must, the British
public are paying for these splendid advertisements!
Paying so well that it is easy to understand how the
Pelman promoters can afford to pay Fifty Guineas, more
or less, to the obliging individuals who are ready and
willing to praise the “system.” Canon Hannay
(“George A. Birmingham”) for instance—does <em>he</em> get
Fifty Guineas? Or Mr. Spencer Leigh Hughes, M.P.?
Or dear George R. Sims? Or Mr. Gilbert Frankau?
Or do they send in their testimonials <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">gratis</i>? I feel
that I cannot be the <em>only</em> “eminent” (to quote advertisement)
person who has received the munificent
offer of Fifty Guineas, and <em>refused the same</em>! In the
Pelman “Census” I note there are 339 accountants,
8 actresses, 490 clergymen, and—one archbishop!
Whereby it would seem that accountants and clergymen
need more brain-prodding than others. And if
the “one Archbishop” should consent to “write up”
the advantages of the “course” (like Mr. Will Owen,
who declares that, artist though he professes to be,
he had “hardly begun the first lesson in Pelmanism
before he discovered something he had been drawing
incorrectly all his life), sure His Grace would merit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>234</span>
a Hundred Guineas for his good work at the very
least? Anyhow his fee should be more than that of a
“bacon-curer” or a novelist! In openly confessing the
offer to myself of Fifty Guineas which I refused without
a moment’s hesitation, I do so that I may call the
attention and admiration of the public to the clever
way certain people manage to make money through
human gullability. The brain-prodders and memory-pushers
are almost as astute as Government officials.
The mass of people who never stop to think, still less
to calculate, are their happy hunting-ground. Personally
I think Pelman and Roth too “sharp” to be of the
Anglo-Saxon race, though I do not assert them to be
Germans, naturalised or <em>de</em>-naturalised. But they have
the Teuton line of intelligence; that is, wherever they
find a good thick soil of stupidity, they plant seed
therein, fertilise it and make it grow. These special
people who feed the coffers of journalism by purchasing
whole pages of space for their advertisements, are so
convinced of the thickness and richness of Anglo-American
stupidity that they boldly offer to transmute it,
like alchemists, into the gold of intellectual ability, and
if this could be done ’twere a worthy thing. But one
must pause at the idea they put forward—“If only
we had 1,000,000 clever thinkers!” It is <em>too</em> terrific!
This poor earth of ours could not survive! Its rolling
ball like a bomb would burst in space, overburdened by
the sheer weight of brain! Be merciful, therefore, O
munificent Pelman! spare us, gentle Roth! Do not
instruct the bacon-curer or train the Archbishop beyond
what we have the strength to endure! Do not compel
us to bow the knee to the “barmaid” as another De
Stael!—to the “corporation official” as a new Admir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>235</span>able
Crichton! It is the American philosopher Emerson
who writes, “Let the world beware when a Thinker
comes into it!” But “1,000,000 thinkers!” The prospect
is horrible—spare us, good Lord! We have much
to be thankful for in Carlyle’s famous assertion “most
fools,” for if our population were all wise, life would
be dull indeed! Fools make the gaiety of nations—they
are the staple support of all governments—the
foundation of the press and the drama—the stock-in-trade
of all authors, philosophers, and wits whatsoever,
and Heaven forbid we should ever be deprived of their
existence! We are always more or less in the position
of Shakespeare’s “melancholy Jacques” and ready to
say, “A fool, a fool, I met a fool i’ the forest! as I
do live by food I met a fool!” and when we chance on
company with this simple friend of all men should we
“Pelmanise” or “Roth” him? Never! He is too valuable
an asset to the world!</p>

allowing labour of tillage and planting the land on
Sundays, for the necessities of the nation’s food. Where
do these contentious persons get their authority? Not
from their divine Master! Their spirit is that of
the Scribes and Pharisees who “watched” Our Lord—“whether
he would heal on the sabbath day, that they
might find an accusation against Him.” The world
has not outgrown that contemptible spirit. “That they
might find an accusation” is often everybody’s aim
and clearest business! “Then said Jesus unto them—I
will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the sabbath
days to do good or to do evil?—to save life or destroy
it?” And when the hypocrites could not answer Him,
He healed the afflicted man who had sought His aid,
whereat those who had “watched” Him, so says the Gospel
narrative, “were filled with madness and communed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>237</span>
one with another what they might do to Him.” But, despite
His scorn of their narrow sectarianism, “He went
out into a mountain to pray, and continued all night
in prayer to God.”</p>

<p>No true servant of Christ can find the least excuse
in any one of the Divine Teacher’s commands for a
rigidly sectarian observance of Sunday. A seventh
day’s rest was wisely and rightly instituted by Moses
for the relief of the Israelites when they had been
worked as slaves by their Egyptian taskmasters; but
Christ never incorporated its observance as any part
of the instructions He gave to His disciples. “What
man shall there be among you,” He said, “that shall
have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath
day, will he not lay hold on it and lift it out? How
much, then, is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore,
it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.”</p>

<p>Mark those last words! They were spoken by One
“in whom there was no guile.” It is lawful to do well
on the sabbath days. And yet, Oh! narrow and rigid
men who “profess” Christ, you, who see and know that
on the feeding of our population depends their health,
their strength, and their ultimate victory over a barbarous
foe, you would discourage the willing hearts
and hinder the ready hands from virtuous and unselfish
labour on Sundays in a time of unexampled
national necessity! Shame! For the blessing of God
must be on all such honest workers whose toil is for
the help and honour of their country. Christ told us
there were but two commandments, not ten—the first:
“Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy soul
and with all thy mind and with all thy strength”—and
the second: “Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>238</span>
There is none other commandment greater than these.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Now what do the dogmatists make of this? If we
truly love God, we surely know His “work” never
ceases. We could not live a second without His sustaining
principle. Every moment of every hour some active
propulsion of creative force labours to produce a result
which is perfect of its kind. On whatever day we sow
our wheat we cannot stop its growing on Sundays.
The energies of Divine beneficence never slacken. If
they did, existence itself would be at an end. Our
“love” of God must therefore include our consciousness
of His unresting “work” for His creation. Then, if
we are to love our neighbour as ourselves, it follows
that we must care for his sustenance as well as our
own. In times like the present we must help him to
produce food for himself and his family, even if we
till the land on Sundays, which, so employed, may be
considered truly “holy” days. For “it is lawful to
do well on the sabbath days,” and it is better to benefit
a neighbour than listen to a sermon. That is, if we
accept the teaching of Christ and assume to be Christians.
The times are pressing; the necessity for food
production urgent; and men owe it as a duty to the
land God gives them that it should yield sufficient to
keep the population in health and safety. Therefore,
if this needful, noble work has to be done quickly, there
is no sin, but rather great virtue and self-sacrifice, in
working on Sundays as well as weekdays during a time
of war and stress. If any of the clergy can quote a
single one of Christ’s own words forbidding necessary
work on Sundays, let them do so. Christ’s own words,
remember! They are generally ignored by all Churches.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>239</span>
Had they ever been obeyed, the purity and strength of
a perfect Faith would, long ere this, have exterminated
War. Now, all good “Christian” clergy, who object
to necessary national work on Sundays, produce your
Master’s warrant for such action—if you can! I say
you cannot!</p>

<span class="subhead">HOW IT MIGHT BE INCREASED

<span class="subhead">(<i>Published in the “Pall-Mall Gazette”</i>)</span></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> are all bound for victory. Every nerve and sinew
of every man and woman in Imperial Britain is bent
on the task of winning it, not only for ourselves, but
for the whole civilised world. America knows, and the
intimidated and secretly tampered with neutrals also
know, as well as we do, that the full triumph of the
Allies means their great peace as well as ours—their
advantage, their progress, their commerce, as well as
ours. That brave and straight-speaking hero of science,
Thomas Edison, recently said: “The people of the
world have willed that they shall be their own masters,
and what the people will is sure to come to pass.” True
enough, it is the people only who can realise every
aim, every ideal, every conquest; and in this matter
of the War Loan they can raise a veritable mountain
of gold if they so determine. But—there is a “but”
in their willingness: an obstacle in the race—they will
not give as much as they would if they have to realise
that some of it or any of it may be used to pay wages
and provide food for German foes dwelling in our
very midst.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Think of it! Is it reasonable, is it just, to ask this
patient, docile, strong, and law-abiding people of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>241</span>
Britain to give their lives, their homes, their children,
their time, with all their service and money, towards
the vigorous and incessant prosecution of the war, when
they know that there are more than 20,000 German
foes kept at large in this realm, free to do as they will?
Twenty thousand, who go about in all towns and
villages unchallenged, listening, spying, noting every
coign and circumstance of vantage, and often (assuming
to be English themselves) using persuasion to prejudice
the Loan among the uninstructed classes.</p>

<p>Twenty thousand enemies, prepared and ready to
work devastation at the first opportunity, while we
“hush up” all that may seem unchivalrous or to the
dear creatures’ detriment! Is it right that these same
Germans should have their own meeting places and
restaurants in London as freely as if they were in
Berlin? And, to add insult to the injury of the whole
position, is it even sane that our authorities should
actually permit Germans to work in our munition
factories? Germans who, when they leave the works
and go to their eating houses, take off their munition
badges and spit on them in token of their contempt
for Britain, even while they are accepting British pay
and eating British food!</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>What does it mean, this employment of Germans in
British munition factories? Death-dealing explosions,
of course! What else can any one, not entirely a
drivelling idiot, expect? Is it likely that a German
will make shells absolutely as they should be made
for the destruction of his own countrymen? No; he
would rather burn down the whole factory!—and he
does if he gets the chance. Nor can he be blamed;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>242</span>
it is the authorities who are to blame for putting him
in the way of temptation to murder. There is something
so “dumb-driven, cattle-like” in the sheer stupidity
of two or three of our Governmental Departments
that one is fain to compassionate them as one might
compassionate sheep bumping their heads against a
stone wall and expecting to get through.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>If a house is threatened with burglary, is it reasonable
to ask the burglar in on a “dine and sleep” visit? Yet
that is what is being done with the Germans in our
country to-day. And it is not possible that our people
can or will rise to their full strength, either in service
or in money, as long as they are affronted by the
presence of the enemy in the centres of their business
and social life. The extraordinary indulgence shown to
the Huns in London is a perpetual worry to our French
friends, who cannot understand it. They discuss it
and deplore it as a sign of weakness. But whatever it
is, we may be sure it will not be allowed to last. Once
the people take the law into their own hands nothing
will stop them. <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Après ça le deluge!</i></p>

<p>No spitting on British munition badges then! No
extra allowances of food to German prisoners while
British folk are ordered to measure their rations!
No “official” posts for men with German wives! Taken
as a whole, the position is more than scandalous. The
British people have every right to demand that their
own land shall be cleansed of all the associates of the
pirates and murderers who slay their men, women,
and children without mercy, and who yet remain here,
living at the nation’s expense. Every German at large
in these islands is a walking “wireless” of swift and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>243</span>
useful information to headquarters. Each new device
of Britain for worsting the foe is at once conveyed to
those most interested, and our newspapers, frequently
more zealous than discreet, lend their aid by giving
details, and often illustrations, of the latest of our
scientific inventions for warfare.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>It is time this matter was handled boldly, with
“gloves off,” as Queen Elizabeth would have handled
it. She would have sent all Germans out of the country
at the very declaration of war, and so would have saved
an infinite number of treasons against the State. Late
in the day as it is, why not send them now? Send them
all, in comfort and luxury if you will, with “rations” of
first-class food, on British ships flying the British flag,
and let them take their chance of the kindness and
humanity of their own countrymen. They will be useful
additions to the “national service” of their Vaterland—we
do not want them here. Our own men and
women will suffice us for our own labor, and work will
be done more readily, while money will flow in more
plentifully, when we are sure that our own land is
purged of the Hun, and that we are not, like fools,
paying to keep and feed plotters against the peace of
the realm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_35">FOOD PRODUCTION<br />

<span class="subhead">A PLEA FOR COMMON SENSE

<span class="subhead">(<i>Published in the “Pall-Mall Gazette”</i>)</span></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Talk</span> of “National Service!” Where is the man,
woman, or child that refuses to do any really necessary
or useful work for the country? Such cannot be found!
There is an eager and splendid willingness in every one
to give his or her best; but without proper organisation
the fine forces of this fine, patient, and enduring people
are scattered and disunited. From all that the bewildered
mind can gather through the roaring megaphone
of an apparently semi-crazed and ruinously
expensive system of advertisement, the National
Service most demanded is “food production.” So says
Mr. Prothero. Very well. Then why not set about it
in an orderly practical manner, without screaming our
shortcomings aloud for the amusement of the Germans?
There is no difficulty whatever in sufficient food production
if some sort of method be brought into the
present chaos. Take this for an <span class="locked">example:—</span></p>

<p>With the help of an old soldier with a wooden leg
and an old man of seventy, a pig farmer and market
gardener was able to put on the market in six months
£1487 worth of pork and £174 of garden produce.</p>

<p>In the next three months he anticipates an addition
to his stock of about 240 pigs from his twenty-five
breeding sows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>245</span></p>

<p>Already he has 211 pigs on the place, apart from the
breeding animals.</p>

<p>What can be done in one place can be done in another,
and if every rural town and village were encouraged
to work its own allotments, if every cottager were
persuaded to grow his or her own garden produce, and
keep pigs and poultry, half the food problem would
be solved. Why not organise such a plan and concentrate
scattered forces? It would be a mistake to confide
the management of such a scheme to “local” magnates,
whether mayors or members of corporations, for
those who have any experience of such “bodies” know
well enough what hindrances they are in the way of
active progress, having always their own axes to grind.
But an impartial, unprejudiced, friendly director of
each agricultural centre, a man or woman of helpful,
sympathetic and practical knowledge, who would encourage
the workers and spare them any of that “superior”
tone of insolence so hurtfully employed by some
of the temporary jacks-in-office on our military tribunals,
could very easily energise the whole business.
Suppose, too, that instead of a daily patter about potatoes
and “shortage,” the Government were to offer
prizes from ten to a hundred pounds for the cottagers
and holders of allotments who, in six months, should
produce most food for their own families and neighbours,
would it not cost less money than the printing
of millions of “food tickets”? Certainly, it would
hearten, not dishearten, the workers, and give them
an extra zest for “production.”</p>

<p>Moreover, it is high time our rulers and Ministers
left off talking about “shortage of food” altogether, if
the following is <span class="locked">true:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>246</span></p>

<p>A statement made in the House of Commons recently
emphasises the fact that German agents are still active
in this country. In refusing to supply a member with
certain information about the supply of aeroplanes, he
said: “Any answer we give in this House is at once
sent to Germany.”</p>

<p>Printed or written information can always be stopped
by the censor. The question remains: How is the
information conveyed?</p>

<p>How, indeed? Why should we give the Huns the
satisfaction of supposing we need food? Or allowing
them to think their U-boats are “blockading” us into
famine? Let the public keep its “weather eye” open,
and consider recent events in Russia! There, part of
the German scheme was “to create an artificial scarcity
of food, so as to precipitate food riots and compel a
separate peace.”</p>

<p>Beware of the dog! How about Great Britain?
Who can swear that the same “influence” is not at work
here, “to create an artificial scarcity of food”? And if
it should be so, why do our politicians fall sheer into
the trap and spread the mischief which the foe may
have started? Food was poured into Petrograd as soon
as the German “unseen hand” was cut off. It is a
significant fact worth remembering!</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Again, let it be emphasised that there is no difficulty
about food production in these islands if the work be
properly organised. Food is not grown on emotional
impulse, such as that displayed by a charming lady
I lately met, who told me with sweet resignation: “I
will not have flowers in my window boxes this summer.
I shall plant potatoes in them instead!” Dear soul!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>247</span>
She evidently thought it worth while! Just as some
folks think it worth while to dig up and disfigure the
parks of London with potato growing when there is
any amount of waste land around which needs cultivation!
One deplores “the falsehood of extremes.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>If we are to accept Mr. Prothero’s statement, the
most important line of “national service” is this food
production. Then, let him take action and not listen
to hearsay or report. Let him see for himself the
thousands of acres in this country waiting to be cultivated
and to produce richly and royally all that is
needed for the population. Let there be common sense
organisation in each district—not “compulsion”; the
people are too cheerfully brave and willing to be “compelled.”
But no one cares to work in the dark without
a plan, and without any encouragement. They are told
to “produce food,” but are denied labour to produce it.
The capable field-worker is taken, and inefficient substitutes
sent instead—men who do not know how to
plant a root or sow a seed, with the obvious result that
plants and seeds represent so much money thrown
away. But, once more to emphasise the need of common
sense, let us hold fast the fact that no lack of food
is possible to this country if things are properly organised.
And as we see by report that, despite U-boats,
ships laden with useful cargoes are constantly arriving
in our ports, let us not forget the possibility of “the
creation of that artificial scarcity” which stirred the
blood and roused the devil in Russia!</p>

<span class="subhead">(<i>Published in the “Pall-Mall Gazette”</i>)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">The</span> Germans are reported to be in ecstasy over what
they call the “despairing appeal” of the Prime Minister’s
great “restrictions” speech. But, however great
their “ecstasy” may be, it can hardly equal ours! For
we have sufficient sense to see what hope and strength
for our Empire springs, like a bright rainbow, from
what the Boche obtusely imagines is a cloud. Our
“lead” is towards increasing prosperity and happiness
for all. We are invited to look forward to a self-supporting
country; we are given fresh chances of barring
the ungrateful Teuton from our trades by showing
him that we can do all our own work ourselves. We are
promised another “Merrie England” of the spacious
days of yore, when foreign supplies were rare and costly,
and when all the fields were thick with golden grain
and all the orchards glowed with many-coloured fruits
and the agricultural population were given the chance
to reap what they had sown.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Now, in our lovely rural villages we may perhaps
hope to see the last of many frowsy, idle sluts who for
years have preferred to gossip away their time rather
than do any useful work; and in their stead we may
look for healthy, active girls and women who are proud
of their dairies and poultry farms, and glad to show
interested customers the great bowls of milk, the churning
of butter, the making of cheese, and all the endless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>249</span>
charms of “country” work well done. If the submarine
menace teaches us to produce all the food that can be
produced in these islands, it will be a blessing in disguise,
a helper and saviour of the grit, stability, and
fine reasonableness of the British race. Talk of potatoes!
There are many hundred of acres of waste land
in South Cornwall alone, notably wide, treeless fields
running into sand dunes by the sea, where the potato
would flourish as well as it does in similar Dutch soil,
and all this precious land is empty and untilled. To
urge the digging up of parks and public recreation
grounds, where it is doubtful whether potatoes would
grow at all, when there is all this acreage available, is
sheer nonsense. I would that I had even a hundred
acres of that Cornish sandy soil by the sea just now.
With a few skilled labourers (for one must know <em>how</em>
to plant potatoes) it should yield gold! At Newquay,
by the way, there is a golfing ground reserved for the
amusement of a dozen or so of privileged selfish persons;
it would grow tons of potatoes and other good
edibles with very little trouble.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Nothing has ever been a greater source of wonder
to me than the improvidence of such British folk as
prefer to buy their vegetables and fruit food rather than
grow it. Nowhere are allotments so untidily kept or so
altogether neglected as in certain parts of England; nowhere
is so little grown in them. Surely it stands to
sense that if each cottager grew his own vegetable and
fruit food there would be less need for foreign supplies.
And if every waste field were made to produce <em>something</em>
in the way of foods a submarine blockade must
needs prove futile in any attempt to starve the popula<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>250</span>tion.
We may, if we will, foresee the vision of a happier,
grander Britain than ever, when the people of these
fruitful islands are given <em>their own</em>, and no longer have
need to sever their lives from the homes of their kindred
because there is no work for them here owing to the
intrusion of German influence and German labour. We
might also consider with belated sorrow the depopulation
of the Scottish Highlands, and the preservation of
vast tracts of moor and forest for mere “sport,” which
has for years been a scandal and a disgrace to the
nation. Let us have the people back on the land, and
let the deer and the grouse take their own wild chances
of existence. The submarine menace has come to teach
us what we ought to have learned long ago—namely,
that what we want on our own land are our own men,
as skilled farmers and workers in every useful and
profitable department, and that it ought never to be
possible to see, as I once saw posted up on a large
factory in London itself: “No English Need Apply.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Look at the thing squarely. With each householder,
in rural districts at least, growing his own vegetable
and fruit supply, and the farmers growing for the community
in general, what lack should there be of the
necessities of life? The Prime Minister has restricted
nothing that we cannot well do without. Somebody has
grumbled about apples. Where will you beat homegrown
apples? Plant orchards of them without stint;
they will repay the trouble. Somebody else grumbles—yes,
we know somebody always grumbles! This time
it is about “Paris hats.” They are “forbidden.” O
wise judge! O learned judge! No more (for a time,
at least) shall we be pestered by receiving elaborate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>251</span>
circulars printed in gold stating that Monsieur Satanique
“presents” his latest “creations,” as if the good Satanique
were a sort of deity. Nor will he, with all his
persuasive charm, be able to entice the foolish among
women to pay him six or eight guineas for a bit of
wire, a scrap of lace, a feather, and a ribbon. O bold
“restriction”! No more “Paris hats”—but, let us
hope, a great deal more common sense!</p>

suffers in the cause of his country. Martyrs are not so
common as heroes nowadays, but Sir George puts in no
claim to heroism. He leaves that to “Tommy.” “Tommy”
makes short work of the Huns wherever and however
he meets them, but Sir George is almost on the
verge of tears because he is unable to make their stay
on in this country as agreeable and profitable as he
would wish.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In the House of Commons he said: “Only the other
day it was his <em>painful duty</em> to order the internment of
sixteen members of one alien club alone!” Alas, alas!
“Sixteen” out of twenty thousand wandering spies!
“One club alone,” out of hundreds of enemy information
centres! Poor Sir George! How his heart must have
been torn! how it must, even now, be lacerated and
sore! “Had this club been in existence during the
whole war?” asked Sir Henry Dalziel pointedly. And
surely Sir George must have fetched a sigh from the
bottom of his soul as he was compelled to answer
“Yes!” Mr. Herbert Samuel, the late Home Secretary,
was also apparently in sad plight, for he “seemed very
anxious about the thousands of friendly aliens” in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>253</span>
East End of London and other large towns. He may
well be “very anxious.” For these “thousands of
friendly aliens” are <em>not</em> “friendly,” and in nine cases
out of ten “show,” as Mr. Samuel gravely observed,
“that their hearts are not with this country.”</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Is Mr. Samuel really so ingenuous, so simple, so
altogether infantile in experience as to suppose their
hearts <em>could</em> be “with this country”? Are the hearts
of Britishers interned in Germany “<em>with</em>” Germany?
The Germans have turned English and Americans out
of Berlin; why is not the same course pursued by us
with Germans in London? Every German in the British
Isles hopes for their “invasion” by his countrymen, and
with invasion the signal to mobilise. With 30,000
interned and 20,000 at liberty, 50,000 foes are in our
midst, ready to turn upon us at short notice. Why
should this matter be dealt with in such a spineless,
semi-paralytic way? What are the British public to
think of the Ministers who put them on “rations” of
four pounds of bread a week, while the German prisoner
is allowed ten? Two and a half pounds of meat to the
German’s three and a half? And everything on the
same scale, so that, summing up the total, the honest
British worker gets seven pounds four ounces of food
to his enemy prisoners’ <em>fourteen pounds fourteen ounces</em>!
Can any Controller of any department be so blind as
to think the British people will stand such injustice?
Many of us know all about Donnington Hall, though
an honest attempt to clear up that scandal was nipped
in the bud by some “Unseen Hand.” But what of the
life of ease led by the German prisoners interned in the
Isle of Man? There, in the great internment camp,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>254</span>
officers are “at home,” and are permitted to buy whatever
quantity of food they like to pay for—food which
the native population cannot get! Just as the enemy
officers at Donnington Hall can order all they like “without
restriction,” while British prisoners in Germany
are given hardly enough to keep them from starving!</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Sir George Cave, in his extreme solicitude for “enemy
aliens,” has committed himself to one utterance which
he may live to regret. It is this: “Enemy aliens freed
from internment ought certainly to be employed on
<em>useful work of national importance</em>.”</p>

<p>Ought they, indeed! The employment of enemy
aliens on “work of national importance” would be little
short of a criminal act. For human nature is the same
as it ever was, and no “enemy alien” is likely to do
“work of national importance” for his jailer or conqueror
without at least <em>trying</em> to do it in such a manner
that it shall never be done, or else done so badly that
it shall not serve its purpose. What sane Englishman
imagines that an “enemy” born of a ruthless race, which

<p>Down in the country, where we are commanded, with
a sort of megaphone shouting through the Press, to
“Grow food,” when we have no skilled labour to grow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>255</span>
it, we are told that we can employ “enemy prisoners” on
the land. A friend, anxious to get waste land under
cultivation, asked what would be the rate of pay. The
reply was: “One guinea a week; fifteen shillings if you
feed him.” Compare this with the pay given to our
British prisoners who work in Germany—“one penny a
day,” <i>i.e.</i>, sixpence a week! My friend decided to put
guineas in the War Loan rather than spend them on a
German prisoner who, if he worked on the land, would
be sure to work “against the grain.” And one asks
again: Why so much indulgence and care for the men
of a dishonourable race who have plunged Europe into
blood and tears, and who have murdered innocent
women and children, and who, far from repenting their
crimes, add to them the awful blasphemy of calling
God to witness their “humanity”? Surely it is time
this weak and nerveless inaction on the part of the
authorities concerned should cease, and that they should,

<span class="subhead">A PROTEST AGAINST A STUPID PANIC

<span class="subhead">(<i>Published in the “Pall-Mall Gazette”</i>)</span></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">No</span> potatoes! Dear, dear; whatever shall we do? Some
of the clever boys who write the “purple patches” for
the sensational Press say that the present shortage is
“nothing compared to the grim possibilities of the near
future.” “Grim possibilities” is good—a phrase that
will delight the Huns! But, quite dispassionately, may
it not be asked how Britain got on without potatoes in
her historic past? Henry VIII. was a goodly King; he
ate greedily, drank heavily, and married profusely, but
never a potato adorned his groaning banquet board. He
“fared sumptuously every day,” and his subjects were
not starved. Strong armies, victorious navies, existed
without potatoes. Crècy, poitiers, Agincourt were
fought on other food. People lived in those days even
more hazardously than they live now, and did not worry
about “grim possibilities.” They grew their own food
produce, and had no chance of Overseas supplies. And
they never knew the potato!</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>The history of the potato is quite modern, proving
that it is by no means a necessity of life. According to
some historians, it is a native of Chili and Peru, and
was introduced from Santa Fé, in America, by Sir John
Hawkins in 1563—one year before the birth of Shakes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>257</span>peare.
So, as it was a new product and uncommon, it
is possible that the Poet of the World struggled up to
manhood without so much as one potato scream! The
soliloquy in <i>Hamlet</i> owes nothing to the potato—the
famous adjuration in <span class="locked"><cite>Henry V.</cite>:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indentq">“Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Or close the walls up with our English dead”—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="in0">has nothing of the “mealy”-mouthed about it! Other
authorities say it was brought over by Sir Francis
Drake in 1586, but not generally introduced till 1592,
and that Sir Walter Raleigh cultivated it first in Ireland
on his estates in the county of Cork. It apparently
was not known in Flanders (according to its biographers)
till 1620. Well, then, how on earth did we get
on without it? And if we <em>did</em> get on without it, why
cannot we get on without it again? I imagine that it
is very much the fault of our gifted melodramatic actors
on the stage of the Press that we are startled and
“shivered” by the thrilling exits and entrances of the
potato at stated intervals. One Bathurst is responsible
for an actual “potato boom,” he having made it appear
that this particular edible is a main prop of existence,
when it is nothing of the kind. He has frightened a
number of unreasoning women into “long queues” that
“besiege” the potato dealers. If these women would
only stay at home and decide to do without potatoes at
all, the “shortage” and the dealers would soon display
an altered aspect! One does not like to be rude about
any portion of the human anatomy, but surely people
who know Ireland have heard of the “potato <em>abdomen</em>”
(the actual word is too Scriptural for polite usage).<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>258</span>
There <em>is</em> such a thing; and it is not at all a desirable
ornament. Women who wish to keep graceful, <em>svelte</em>
figures never eat potatoes. In all dietetic rules for the
fat, “grave” warnings are uttered against potatoes, and
“grim possibilities” are in store for any obstinately
large man or woman who continues to eat them!</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>Why should the restless Bathurst seek to create a sort
of South Sea Bubble in potatoes? The frenzy need not
spread, if reasonable folk will collect their wits (some
of which have gone a wool gathering) and realise that
the potato, though an excellent vegetable when properly
cooked (which it seldom is) is not a necessity of life.
If it were, the brilliant history of Britain from the
beginning up to Tudor times would be a mere record
of famines. Pessimist Bathurst “gravely” states that
“there will be no potatoes for any one in about six
weeks.” Well, all who have vegetable gardens know
that there is always a scarcity of potatoes every year,
when the old ones are practically finished and we are
waiting for the new; and owing to the general “sensationalism”
the scarcity this year is likely to be more
pronounced. But it need not disturb any one’s equanimity.
Potatoes are no more necessary to life and
health than the “hot roll,” of which the following
amazing report appears in the Press: “The passing of
the hot roll is the chief sacrifice.” (Think of these
noble words! “The chief sacrifice!” One would imagine
it was the life of a hero!) “Tens of thousands of
people will lament the loss of a breakfast luxury!”
“Lament the loss?” Oh, oh! Tens of thousands of
people lamenting a hot breakfast roll! Ye Gods! “A
roll,” continued the Press-interviewed baker, “alters its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>259</span>
character when stale.” True, deplorably true! But if
those tens of thousands of lamenting people do not alter
<em>their</em> character and “lament” to better purpose than for
the daily indigestion provided for them in “hot roll” at
breakfast, it is time they felt the pinch, not only of “no
potatoes,” but “no food” at all for a wholesome period
of fasting, with shame and penitence!</p>

<span class="subhead">A STUDY IN WAR BREAD

<span class="subhead">(<i>Published in the “Pall-Mall Gazette”</i>)</span></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Complaints</span> are rife and bitter concerning the tough,
indigestible, and injurious mixture permitted to the
taxpaying public as “war bread.” General condemnation
of Government flour has been expressed at a meeting
of the London Master Bakers’ Protection Society,
where a resolution was passed asking for an interview
with the Prime Minister to point out the “ineptitude”
of the Ministry of Food. Thousands of us are of the
same mind with the Master Bakers! Thousands of us
affirm the “ineptitude” of which they speak. Thousands
of us know that a more lamentable display of ignorance
concerning the “things that matter” could hardly be
seen between now and the next world. Furthermore,
the Master Bakers (God bless them!) have actually
declared that if the Bread Order is not revoked or
amended they, to safeguard the health of consumers,
will be compelled to take “drastic action.” Well done,
Master Bakers! The sooner this drastic action is
effected the better for many ailing, suffering human
creatures. The faddists and health specialists may talk
as they will, nothing can satisfy the appetite or suit
the palate of the average man and woman so well and
so safely as bread made with <em>pure white flour</em>. The raw
germ of wheat, though in a sense nutritious, exercises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>261</span>
a “very deleterious effect,” so say the bakers, on the
colour and keeping qualities of the loaf. In many cases
“war bread” causes internal hæmorrhage, to say nothing
of fermentative dyspepsia and severe inflammation of
the delicate coating of one’s interior mechanism, and it
would be easy to compile a volume of statistics proving
the poisonous effect produced by this coarse stuff on our
soldiers in hospital who are slowly recovering from
gunshot wounds or shell shock, and who are peculiarly
sensitive to the quality of their food. The distinguished
muddlers who are muddling with the grain and the
“milling” thereof, seem to judge the fine and complex
human organism as somewhat tougher than shoe-leather
and less liable to injury than pig-iron. But they are
not the first of their class by any means! There were
muddlers before them, as senseless, as callous, and as
deaf to reason as they—men who, like themselves, were
“dressed in a little brief authority” during that terrific
upheaval of which the very name is ominous—the great
French Revolution. Here is what Carlyle writes of the
bread trouble in those <span class="locked">days:—</span></p>

<p>“Complaints there are that the food is spoiled and
produces an effect on the intestines, as well as ‘a smarting
in the thoat and palate,’ which a municipal proclamation
warns you to disregard or even to consider as
drastic—beneficial! But ... the Mayor of Saint
Denis, so black was his bread, has, by a dyspeptic
populace, been hanged on ‘La Lanterne’ there!”</p>

<p>“La Lanterne” is not a pleasant theme to dwell upon,
and we may be deeply thankful that we have something
nowadays less ferocious than such a form of settling
disputes between the people and their rulers—the great
trade unions and protection societies, consolidated bodies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>262</span>
of reasoning and reasonable men, who can, when necessity
calls, take concerted action against Sentimental
Cant and wilful Ignorance. For, to quote Carlyle
again, “Is not Cant the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">materia prima</i> of the Devil,
from which all falsehoods, imbecilities, and abnominations
body themselves, from which no true thing <em>can</em>
come?” And are not the Master Bakers, as well as the
Seamen’s and Firemen’s Union, conscious of this Cant
somewhere? Whether in pacifism or food-controlling,
matters little, so long as they can put an exterminating
finger on the spot!</p>

<p>Ours is a land of cranks; we produce cranks as
quickly as untended grass grows plantains. We have
peace cranks, food cranks, health cranks; and, without
doubt, plenty of these will dash wildly into the open
with hysterical hymns of praise for the utterly detestable
“war bread,” more vigorously possibly when they
think their fellow-creatures are being made ill by it.
But “let ’em gnash as can,” as the toothless old dame
blandly observed after hearing a sermon on hell where
“there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Happily
deprived of all ability to “gnash,” hell offered no alarms
for her. Similarly, those whose powers of digestion
cannot tolerate “war bread” will support the screams
of whole-meal faddists with equanimity, saying, “Let
’em masticate as can.” If “whole-meal” gives strength
and sustenance with hæmorrhage, most of us will prefer
to be a little less strong and well-nourished, without
internal bleedings. The complaints of the bread sold
in Paris during the fateful months preceding the French
Revolution are precisely the same as now; but, whatever
the rising tide of discontent may be, we have
bulwarks against it in our own people’s organisations,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>263</span>
which bind the members of every trade together against
any possible injustice or tyranny. This Empire has
cause to be thankful for its vast network of trade
unions; they are in very truth a governing body whose
weight and importance cannot be over-estimated. And
so it may be that the Master Bakers will be the saviours
of the country’s health, despite Food Controllers and
their ideas of “milling.” We are losing enough life,
Heaven knows, on the fields of battle; we do not want
illness and the spread of disease at home. We can be
sparing and careful of grain and precious with our
“white flour,” but we need not debilitate or poison our
people with food which they cannot digest or which
in any way proves injurious to women and children.
Waste is encouraged by the making of bread which
the people dislike. They would rather throw it away
than suffer illness—which is very natural. The Food
Controller is safe from “La Lanterne” in these days;
but everybody will be glad if the London Master
Bakers’ Society will take the matter well in hand and
see to it that we need not “live on the husks which the
swine did eat.” The country will not starve because
we prefer to be well on white flour rather than dyspeptic
on brown!</p>

<span class="subhead">A NAVAL CHADBAND

<span class="subhead">(<i>Published in the “Pall-Mall Gazette”</i>)</span></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">So</span> now we know! No longer need we denounce the
“submarine menace”; no longer need we (as the German
Press suggests) “grow pallid with fear,” for we
are in “brave and gallant hands!” “Brave and gallant”
are the noble creatures who sink hospital ships;
“brave and gallant” are the sharers of dividends in the
corpse-fat factory; “brave and gallant” are the raiders
who sought to intercept the Prime Minister on his way
back from France across Channel in order to make
short work of him and his escort—“brave and gallant”
are they all! Our own Vice-Admiral at Dover implied
as much when, with all the unctuousness of Dickens’s
immortal Mr. Chadband, he laid a wreath of flowers on
the coffin of one of the Hun raiders with the inscription:
“To a brave and gallant enemy!” He spared no
wreath and offered no tribute to any of the dead among
our own bluejackets, whose “brave and gallant” conduct
had succeeded in beating off and sinking the enemy’s
ships; they were “only” British sailors. But for the
dead Huns, this British Vice-Admiral publicly displayed
the tenderness of a twin brother. One wonders
what Nelson would have said to such an action? How
does it accord with the Defence of the Realm? One
can imagine the noble dust of the victor of Trafalgar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>265</span>
stirring for very shame at such a lack of dignity at
the very time when British ships are being wickedly
sunk and British lives wickedly lost by the nefarious
“brave and gallant” brutality of an enemy with whom
honour is a mere straw. It may perhaps be easier now
to understand the rumours that these “brave and gallant”
Huns are allowed to work with our men in British
docks, where they watch our ships loaded with millions
of munitions, and count up our troops leaving for the
front, and then, without doubt, communicate with their
kinsmen of the submarines, letting them know the
hour and moment of departure! No wonder that our
ships are sunk! Such methods prepare the way for
their sinking. No action is taken by the authorities to
put a stop to the inroad of German labour in the docks
alongside of the British—a state of things which, on
the face of it, invites and encourages spying and treachery.
Such scandals are “an offence that’s rank, And
smells to Heaven”; and the powers in office who allow
them to go on without check are nearly as guilty of the
loss of torpedoed ships and lives as the Huns themselves.
And when a British Vice-Admiral sets the hall-mark
of “brave and gallant” on even a dead specimen of the
most treacherous, inhuman, and barbaric foe his country
has ever had to contend with, we can hardly wonder
at anything except the amazing excess of patience, wellnigh
lethargy, with which the British people tolerate
such an exhibition of Chadbandism in the Navy. One
is thankful for the plain speaking of Admiral Lord
Charles Beresford, who, in the House of Lords, designated
this action as one of “maudlin sentimentality and
shoddy chivalry.” There spoke the sturdy seaman and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>266</span>
loyal Britisher, untainted by the pro-German measles,
which infect only the degenerates of our race. The
Vice-Admiral at Dover, by his openly displayed admiration
for the Hun, would seem to wish us to understand
that he is something neither British nor of the sea—“neither
fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring.” We
can almost hear him soliloquising over the flower-strewn
coffin of the “brave and gallant” Hun: “My
friend, you are to me a pearl, you are to me a diamond,
you are to me a gem, you are to me a jewel! And why,
my friend? Are you a beast of the field? No. A
bird of the air? No. A fish of the sea or river? No.
You are a Hun, my friend! You are much worse
than any beast of the field; more voracious than any
bird of the air; more slippery than any fish of the sea
or river! Oh, how glorious to be a Hun! And if I
went forth as far as the Southampton Docks and there
saw a ‘brave and gallant’ fellow-countryman of yours
taking stock of troops and munitions, and I was to
come back and call unto me Sir Edward Carson and say
unto him, ‘Lo the docks are barred against Huns,’ would
that be terewth?”</p>

<p>No; it would not be “terewth”—unless, as the original
Chadband propounded, such terewth, or truth,
were another form of deception. Until we have loyal
men “above suspicion” in authority at home we shall
never satisfy our Allies abroad. America will be unable
to understand a British Vice-Admiral laying flowers
on the coffin of an enemy whose intent was, without
doubt, to sink and slay a valuable life on which much
of Britain’s welfare depends, any more than she will
understand the collection of a large sum of money for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>267</span>
the assistance of Germans in England (more than
£17,000) to which liberal subscriptions have been
made by two German members of the Privy Council.

me, with the real “city officers Dogberry and Verges”—in
fact “the whole dissembly appeared.” I was summoned
for “hoarding” sugar. In plain truth I have
never “hoarded” anything—not even money, as the
town of Stratford-on-Avon has sufficient reason to know.
I have never even had the careful housekeeper’s habit
of a “store-cupboard”—my house being destitute of
such lock-up conveniences, wherefore we have found it
best always to order what is wanted from week to week,
paying for it likewise from week to week and incurring
no debts. In the affair of the sugar I could not procure
enough to obey the commands set upon me by the
Food Production and other Government Departments.
Correspondence with Mr. Prothero had impressed upon
me that there was a shortage of all foodstuffs, especially
butter, and it was represented to me that every householder
growing their own fruit should make as much
jam as possible to replace the butter. That year (1917)
was a wonderful fruit year; in my own garden, not an
“orchard” by any means or abundantly stocked, there
was gathered nearly a thousand pounds dead-weight of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>273</span>
fruit. Some of it we sold—much of it we gave away—the
rest had either to be wasted or preserved. “Shortage
of foodstuffs” necessitated its preservation. Our
local surveyor, though obliging, could not supply his
customers with enough sugar to go round. The “Hoarding
Act” distinctly stated that the order did not apply
itself to “sugar obtained for the preservation of homegrown
produce”—so I appealed to my old friend, Sir
Thomas Lipton, not only because he was a friend, but
because he was a grocer, and as such, would be sure
to know what quantity of sugar he might or might not
sell to any customer. But——! Here comes in another
story!</p>

<p>A short time previous to the Sugar-Comedy of
“Much Ado,” I had been approached by two gentlemen
from Birmingham on behalf of the Y.M.C.A. and
Sir Arthur Yapp (then Director of Food Economy) to
help the Society by a subscription. I gave a hundred
pounds; and a generous friend of mine, on hearing
what I had subscribed, gave another hundred. In the
warmth of this success I wrote to Sir Thomas Lipton
and asked him boldly for another hundred. I received
a truly heart-rending reply to the effect that he was a
“poor man,” and “could not afford so large a sum,”
but that if I had asked him for ten or fifteen pounds
he would have gladly subscribed. I at once seized the
opportunity and begged him to send the fifteen. He did
so, and I wrote my acknowledgments, assuring him that
when he went to heaven that Fifteen Pounds given to
the Y.M.C.A. would be an extra feather in his Angel-Wing!
(I do hope he will one day show that letter
to Sir Arthur Yapp!) Then, feeling I had not yet
done enough for the Y.M.C.A. Huts, I agreed that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>274</span>
Cinema company, then running some stories of mine
on the “film,” should give a few “shows” of them in
Stratford for the sole benefit of the Y.M.C.A., and
I am glad to say that they drew packed houses and
brought a substantial result. For this and such assistance
as I had freely given to help on the good cause I
had a note from Sir Arthur Yapp expressing his “most
grateful thanks.” And now we can <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">revenons à nos
moutons</i>—that is to say, I can return to the Sugar
version of “Much Ado”—but I would earnestly request
my readers to “mark, learn, and inwardly digest” what
we may call “The Y.M.C.A.-Yapp Interlude.”</p>

<p>As I have already stated, I could not get sufficient
sugar from the local grocer to preserve the fruit in
hand, and as fruit is perishable, and there was no time
to be lost, I rang up Sir Thomas Lipton on the telephone
and asked him what he could do for me. The
familiar “Glasgie” accent came harmoniously along the
wire—“Ye’ll never want for sugar so long as Tom
Lipton’s on the ‘phone!”</p>

<p>So it was settled. I and my friend (a lady who has
been my companion throughout my life since my childhood,
and who has generously and kindly undertaken
all my household cares) set happily to work to preserve
our fruit; whole in jars where we could do so, but made
into jam for the most part. I would here remark, with
all diffidence, that I do not revel in jam myself; but
I like having it for others—such as schoolboys, for
instance, before whom whole pots vanish like snow in
the sun when they come to tea with me, bless their frank
appetites! We had nearly completed our labours, all
except the transmutation of apples into jelly and “apple
cheese” (the best possible substitute for butter), when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>275</span>
one afternoon, while I was out, a police constable called
and said he must search the house for “hoards.” He
brought no authority, but stated that if he were refused
he would procure a search warrant. My friend,
who received the intruder, was naturally rather surprised,
but having nothing to hide she cordially invited
the official to go all over the house wherever he would.
Accordingly he tramped into the dining-room, opened
cupboards and drawers, even peering into an unobtrusive
little tea-caddy, and went down into the cellar and inspected
the larder. He found nothing but a large flour-bin,
into which for convenience had been put fifteen
pounds of sugar (duly weighed) left for use with the
apples yet to be preserved. While he was still on the
prowl, I returned home, and though I am never much
taken aback at anything Stratford-on-Avon “authorities”
do, I was, I think, justifiably annoyed at having
my private rooms searched on such a ridiculous charge
of which I was absolutely guiltless. Moreover, the
“hofficer” who had thus broken into my house without
warning, was a man who had often had supper in our
kitchen with beer <em>galore</em>, which he had greatly relished—while
another detail of the matter was that for some
years, since the intrusion of an unhappy lunatic-tramp
into my garden, the police had been given by myself a
private key to the premises, so that they could enter at
any time. Therefore, if they had sought to keep me
under “observation” there was nothing to hinder their
surveillance, which indeed I had personally requested
and was grateful for. But—as the official informed me
the “hoarding” accusation came “from London”—“on
account of Sir Thomas Lipton.” This rather amazed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>276</span>
me, and for a moment I thought it must be that “feather
in the Angel-Wing”! My doubts were soon set at rest
by a visit from my solicitor who told me Sir Thomas
was “much distressed and could not sleep” for thinking
about the threatened trouble. Some one at certain
Stratford-on-Avon Stores had noted the arrival at the
railway station of the Lipton supplies of sugar—quite
openly sent, and openly marked “Sugar,” for we were
under the impression that all was in due observance
of the Food Production rules, and that there was nothing
to hide or to “hoard.” Naturally I wrote at once
to the Lipton office requesting these supplies to be
stopped, without, however, at once succeeding, as, notwithstanding
my expressed desire, a fresh package was
transmitted, which I promptly returned. I then wrote
to Sir Arthur Yapp, feeling quite sure that his recent
experience of my conduct in respect to the Y.M.C.A.
would convince him that there was some “official blundering”
(to quote a press term) in the absurd notion
that I, whose work throughout the war had been to help,
not to hinder all patriotic aims, could possibly sink to
the “hoarding” level. I had written to him long before,
pleading that the poor working women should not be
compelled to stand in “queues,” waiting to get food for
themselves and their children, on which subject he wrote
me the following <span class="locked">letter:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigright">“December 17, 1917.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Corelli</span>,—Thank you very much indeed
for your further letter and enclosure, and I hope to be
able to arrange for the workers to get things for their
children. All the points you mention shall receive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>277</span>
careful attention and I am consulting some of my colleagues
forthwith. Again thanking you,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l6">“Yours faithfully,</span><br />
<span class="l4">“<span class="smcap">A. K. Yapp</span>,</span><br />
“<i>Director of Food Economy</i>.”
</p></div>

<p class="in0">This does not look as if I had sought to “rob the poor
by hoarding,” as one accuser in the “gutter” press made
out later on! When I wrote, explaining the position
which had so wrongfully arisen, Sir Arthur wrote regretting
it and saying: “I will make all inquiries and
am more than sorry you should be worried.”</p>

<p>However, the “case” instigated “from London,” went
on remorselessly and I asserted my innocence in vain.
A second appeal to Sir Arthur Yapp, strengthened by
a personal visit to him from my solicitor who urgently
pointed out the absurdity of the “hoarding” charge in
my regard, brought the <span class="locked">following:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“<span class="smcap">National Council</span>, Y.M.C.A.</span><br />
December 26, 1917.
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Corelli</span>,—Thanks for your letters. I
was glad to see your solicitor, but am not sure that I
can help you. I will gladly do so if I can. Unfortunately
all the people are away for a few days. I will
try to get in touch with the Chairman of the Sugar
Commission to-morrow, Friday or Saturday. I will
write again. I am so sorry you are having this worry.
In haste,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l1">“Yours sincerely,</span><br />
”<span class="smcap">A. K. Yapp</span>.”
</p></div>

<p class="in0">Nevertheless, with all this amiable “Yapp-ing” he did
<em>not</em> “get in touch” with the Chairman of the Sugar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>278</span>
Commission, then Sir Charles Bathurst, who wrote
himself and told me he had never heard a word of the
affair till he saw it in the newspapers. On this point
my solicitor wrote as follows: “I am glad to hear that
you have a letter from Sir Charles Bathurst, expressing
sympathy. I cannot, however, overlook the fact that
whereas Sir Arthur Yapp had no power apart from
Sir Charles to take cognisance of facts which I brought
to his notice with a view to stopping an unjustifiable
prosecution calculated to do you an injury, Sir Charles
Bathurst had ample power and did not exercise it,
although approached by Sir Arthur Yapp. I do not
think the Food Control Department even troubled to
send the case to their counsel, but merely seized the
opportunity to accept a statement which was not in
conformity with the evidence, was a violation of the
highest principles of justice, and a slur upon the
summary jurisdiction of the land.”</p>

<p>And so the case went on. Yapp meantime addressed
a crowd on Tower Hill and assured them “Marie Corelli’s
sugar had been taken from her”—which was a
flaring fiction as there was no excess of sugar to take.
He failed to mention that the victim he thus pilloried
had given far more than the sugar’s worth to the
Y.M.C.A., of which he posed as the pious and conscientious
Head! But “that’s another story”! He
felt perfectly justified, however, in handing over my
personal letters to him (marked “Private”) to a Mr.
Wise, his secretary, I believe, whom my solicitor found
reading them to his lady clerks by way of a little
entertainment—and so altogether I rank Sir Arthur
Yapp with Shakespeare’s Brutus, and here express my
profound acknowledgments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>279</span></p>

<p>On the 2nd of January, 1918, the case for my
“hoarding” was tried by the eminent “bench” of
Stratford-on-Avon. My servants were subpœnaed—they
sat patiently in court, but nobody asked them a
single question! A legal representative of Sir Thomas
Lipton’s, glib as Sergeant Buzfuz, managed things for
his principal in such a way as to leave Sir Thomas
scot-free, though in other similar cases the supplier was
fined in the same sum as the supplied. I was not in
court. My friend, who has all the responsibility of
housekeeping, went into the witness-box and answered
all questions plainly and honestly—but plainness and
honesty do not count for much in law. The point which
Dogberry and Verges adhered to was that they did not
believe we had used the sugar for jam! Was ever anything
more absurdly humorous! We were ready and
willing to make public exhibition of the jam; we offered
those amazing “city officers” free permission to inspect
it—but <em>they would not</em>! They preferred to doubt the
word of a lady through whose hands many hundreds of
pounds had been spent in the town and whose well-known
straightforward character makes her incapable
of truckling to falsehood or hypocrisy. I must not
forget to mention that the worthy Dogberrys had been
much bamboozled by the constant delivery of large
wooden boxes at my house labelled “Maypole Tea,”
“Tate’s Sugar,” “Nestle’s Milk,” etc., etc.; it looked
very like “hoarding,” surely? A constable followed the
packages up through an open passage leading to out-houses,
and there to his immense chagrin discovered that
these cases contained nothing but material for electric-wiring
and lighting, sent by Messrs. Tredegars of Brook
Street, who had undertaken the installation of the elec<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>280</span>tric
light in my house. They were compelled to pack
their goods in any boxes they could secure, there being
a “shortage” in packing-cases as in everything else, and
when the “hoarding” trial came on, the director of the
firm offered most kindly and courteously to attend the
court and explain the share his boxes had in the silly
accusation. But there was no need; Dogberry and
Verges had already made up their minds. My chief
assailants were the Superintendent of Police in Stratford
and the Town Clerk—and after the case was over
and they had “convicted” me of what I had never
committed (though the “bench” disagreed among themselves),
all the clues were placed in my hands in such
a remarkable way as would remind one of Sherlock
Holmes if there were time or space to tell it! Perhaps
the following sentence from a legal document may put
the matter <span class="locked">clearly:—</span></p>

<p>“The root of the whole evil is your local bench, and
bias is self-evident by the action of the Acting Clerk,
<em>when he withheld information from us as to the findings
of the Justices until after the time to appeal to Quarter
Sessions had elapsed</em>.”</p>

<p>I have often wondered why this malignity? Why,
too, on the part of the “Acting Clerk,” whom I have
always beheld with respectful admiration in his curly
white wig marching in the Shakespeare Sunday or
Mayoral processions to Church? He is my beau-ideal
of a cultured Dogberry—his very look and movement
express—“I am a wise fellow; and which is more an
officer; and which is more a householder; and which
is more as pretty a piece of flesh as any in Messina
(Stratford) and one that knows the law, go to; and
a rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>281</span>
had losses; and one that hath two gowns and everything
handsome about him! O that I had been writ
down——” No—I will not finish the quotation; suffice
it to say that I have never intentionally or to my knowledge
caused offence to this excellent man. But both
Church and State were in the persecution of my quite
innocent personality; two dismissed outdoor employés
of my own first started the mischief, and as one had
found a temporary job on the local “food control,” it
was easy to trace the work of hands guided by personal
spite and desire to give me trouble. Afraid to start the
accusation in Stratford itself, they quite ingenuously
managed to transfer it through a mutual friend to
London, from whence the “summons” was “arranged”
to come—and since then, having found out the whole
petty plot, I have been full of amused compassion for
the miserable plotters. They must surely feel that the
game was hardly worth the candle! Of course, press-reporters
rushed down like hounds in full cry directly
they scented possible injury to me—they would never
have troubled themselves to note anything I did of
good—but anything that savoured of meanness and disloyalty
on my part was “nuts” to them! As they never
saw me, and I made no appearance in court, these poor
untidy pressmen were reduced to their usual fictions,
and wired all over the world that I had “made a scene in
court,” “attacked Lloyd George,” etc., etc.! (And yet,
just before this comedy started, and â propos of sugar,
I had sent Miss Megan Lloyd George some chocolate
“eclairs” made at home, with which this charming little
friend of mine was much delighted!) Yes—these chivalrous
press-men labelled me from England to furthest
Ind as a hoarder and hypocrite and I was left without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>282</span>
remedy. I was assailed by the lowest anonymous letters
and post cards; of course one knows how to take such
off-scourings of depraved human minds, as no one but
a villain, male or female, would write an anonymous
letter. But with all the pain I felt at the misjudgment,
amounting almost to cruelty, of the press, which deliberately
did its best to injure me with my reading public,
I had my compensations. I had hundreds of letters
from our men at the front indignantly protesting against
the wrong done to me—and a wonderful document
signed by the officers and men of the Overseas Military
Forces of Canada came to hearten me up by its generous
testimony as <span class="locked">follows:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We, the undersigned Officers, Non-Commissioned
Officers, and Men of the Overseas Military Forces of
Canada desire to take this opportunity of expressing
to you our gratitude for the many acts of kindness and
hospitality that you have shown to the members of the
Canadian Forces since they arrived in this country.</p>

<p>“We also wish to express to you our sympathies in
the recent cruel and unjust charge of ‘hoarding’ which
was brought against you, and we feel sure that when the
true facts are brought to the knowledge of the public
they will realise that the spirit of patriotism you have
shown throughout the war, and the generosity with
which you have contributed articles to the various periodicals
published for the benefit of the troops do not
coincide with the possibility of any contravention of war
measures.</p>

<p>“We also wish to add the expression of our admiration
for the pre-eminent position you have attained in the
world of literature and art, and to assure you that none<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>283</span>
appreciate your works more than the people of Canada.</p>

<p>“We trust that this assurance of our admiration for
your genius, and our sympathy in the worry to which
you have been so unjustly subjected, will prove to you
that we are not unmindful of the kindness and warm
interest you have invariably shown towards Canadian
soldiers.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“We beg to remain,</span><br />
”Sincerely yours,”
</p></div>

<p class="in0">Here followed a long list of officers’ and men’s names;
the kind and generous testimonial of their friendship
was dated from Bramshott Camp, Hants, April 16th,
1918.</p>

<p>I make no comment on this most valued “vote of
confidence” voluntarily given by brave and chivalrous
men. I publish it just as it is—one of my most precious
possessions. I can endure even dear Dogberry’s malice
with such a battalion of fighting friends!</p>

<p>One other thing may be mentioned as showing the
curious cross-purposes of the Stratford-on-Avon “justices”
in the prosecution against me, and that is the
letter written to me by the Deputy-Mayor on the eve
of the <span class="locked">trial—thus:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="sigright">“December 31, 1917.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Corelli</span>,—Allow me to offer you my
sincere wishes that the year 1918 may prove to you
and yours one of unalloyed happiness. In these days
such a wish may seem impossible of achievement.
Amidst the strife of nations and the world-wide clash
of arms there must be anxiety and care for all who love
their country, and the ‘petty pin-pricks’ which come to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>284</span>
all who try to do their duty will no doubt try the temper
and patience; but amidst all life’s worries the consciousness
of duty done, of love for others, and the desire to
do always what is right will bring <em>you</em> that real peace
and happiness which the world cannot give. That you
may have this in 1918 and the years to follow is my
earnest wish. With kind regards,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l4">“Yours sincerely,</span><br />
“<span class="smcap">Fred Winter</span>.”
</p></div>

<p>So was the “Winter of my discontent” moved to try
making a bit of “glorious summer” on the eve of the
“Hoarding” case! I was grateful, of course—and I
did not allow myself to dwell on the thought that
perhaps, only perhaps, he was thus moved because long
before the “hoarding” case, my “hoarding” tendencies
had prominently displayed themselves in agreeing to
pay £60 towards the restoration of his ancient house in
the High Street, a sum which no one else volunteered!
I did it for love and honour of the town’s antique
beauty—not for any self-laudation or advantage; and I
am glad to have been of some use in this direction. It
is a quaint coincidence that this same Deputy-Mayor,
when I previously aided the restoration of the now
famous “Tudor” House opposite the Town Hall, accused
me in the local press of doing it for “self-advertisement.”
I am sure he must regret this temporary misjudgment
now that his own house shows its Henry
VIIth timbers to the light of day.</p>

<p>Briefly to sum up, I am and always have been
absolutely guiltless of “hoarding” anything. I would
rather give than receive, and am quite an adept at
“doing without.” And if I may presume to quote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>285</span>
finally from the original <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> I
can say that while I am perfectly aware of the local
“Conrade” and “Borachio” who vented their spite
against me, I think there are many now in Stratford-on-Avon
itself who would say with the original <span class="locked">Dogberry:—</span></p>

<p>“Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover,
they have spoken untruths; secondarily they are
slanderers; sixth and lastly they have belied a lady;
thirdly they have verified unjust things.”</p>

<p>As for the excellent Sir Thomas Lipton, who was
much more troubled in his mind about this little affair
than I was, and who, though he supplied the contested
sugar, escaped all fine and also escaped the contumely
of the press which was heaped upon me like a cartload
of bricks, without rhyme or reason, without honesty or
justice, and without a single word of truth in the various
reports cabled all over the world to do me as much
injury as possible; he was so relieved and happy to think
nothing was said about his own share in the matter that
he was more genial and delightsome than ever. And I
have reason to believe that he is “flattered to death,”
as our American cousins sometimes say, by the parody
I wrote for him “after Robert Burns,” which I <span class="locked">call—</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_43">THREE HUNDRED YEARS OF FAME<br />

<span class="subhead">AVE SHAKESPEARE!</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Three</span> hundred years ago, on April 23, 1616, William
Shakespeare, of whom Carlyle wrote as “the pink and
flower of remembered Englishmen—the greatest thing
we have yet done and managed to produce in this
world,” drew his last breath at “New Place,” the home
he had earned for himself in his native town of Stratford-on-Avon.
The great bell of the Guild Chapel
facing the garden side of his “pretty house of brick and
timber” tolled for his passing; but the great voice of
the world which acclaims him so loudly to-day was
dumb.</p>

<p>In those Puritan times he was but little considered;
and no hint or whisper of his coming renown stirred the
sleepy quietude of the little country place where he
was born and where he died. His fellow-townsmen
of that period kept no particular record of him, nor
did they dream of him as the future King of English
Literature. He was laid to rest in the chancel of the
Parish Church—an honoured place allowed to him, not
because of his genius as a Poet, for this was as indifferent
a matter then to the good bucolic folk of Stratford-on-Avon
as it is now, but because he had, by
purchase, become part owner of the tithes and as a lay-rector
had right of interment there.</p>

<p>In his lifetime he assumed to be nothing but a simple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>289</span>
industrious man of business who “adapted” and rearranged
old plays to suit the requirements of the Globe
Theatre; and he flung out the splendid rays of his
dazzling poetic genius over these dry bones of romance
and history as freely and with as grand an absence
of self-consciousness as the sun which shines alike
on the just and the unjust.</p>

<p>Nothing probably would have surprised him more or
moved him to such incredulous smiling as to have been
told that in three hundred years his fame would surpass
that of any other Englishman ever born! He would
have put aside the prophecy with good-humoured laughter
and would never have given it another thought.
For his wordly aims were perfectly straightforward and
simple; they were, plainly—to earn a sufficient competence
and to stand on an independent footing with
his fellows, to live with his family in ease and comfort,
and to end his days in peace in the town where
he was born. No ideal could be more free from arrogance.
His whole career is an object lesson of infinite
Greatness to the infinitely Little!</p>

<p>The vital centre of Shakespeare’s marvellous power
is surely his impersonality. His creative spirit moved
behind the passing show of kings and queens and historic
events, moulding them to his mood, but never
displaying itself. Like light it shed colour on whatsoever
it illumined. So little may we guess of Shakespeare’s
personality from his writings that he has made
of himself an Enigma. We cannot even tell what form
of creed he professed, though we know and feel that
the devout worship of an invisible and intelligent Force
behind Nature filled him with highest faith and purest
service towards God. We cannot find out his special<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>290</span>
likes or dislikes, save in slight indications here and
there, such as his plainly indicated abhorrence of Jews—and
Germans! Great as is the professed admiration
of the Teuton for our English Master-Mind, we wonder
how he can get over such lines as <span class="locked">these:—</span></p>

<p>One other thing we may perceive, and that is our
Poet’s scorn of pettiness and treachery. Individual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>291</span>
deceit—public or private hypocrisy—these seem to
Shakespeare’s mind unforgivable. The “black-handed”
hit—the cruel slander—the malicious lie—against these
he delivers his most trenchant blows; but farther than
this we are unable to penetrate into the kingdom of
his heart or sentiment.</p>

<p>To woman he assigns the highest place as inspirer
and saviour of man; when he shows her other than
this, as in Lady Macbeth, he makes remorse half condone
her sins and death conclude them. He seemed to
be absolutely unconscious of any superiority in himself
to others of his own calling. His poetic gift was like
song to a nightingale that warbles for sheer delight and
amorousness, in delicious ignorance of the entrancing
beauty of its melody.</p>

<p>What affects, or <em>should</em> affect, us most deeply to-day
is the deplorable fact that for three hundred years we
have had no poet, no dramatist, to approach Shakespeare
in any sense—neither in beauty of language,
loftiness of thought, nor simple naturalness of expression.
He towers among us as a veritable giant among
pigmies—for the men of letters in all parts of the
world at this epoch, men who are scrambling and pushing
themselves forward to offer a very poor and inadequate
“homage” to this mightiest genius of all time,
are of such microscopic attainment when compared with
him that one needs a mental lens to perceive them at
all.</p>

<p>These are they for whom Self is not only the keynote,
but the whole tune. Some of them take pride
in their “style”; whereas Shakespeare had no “style”
save his own, which has become a living part of the
English language. He defied laws and conventions and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>292</span>
dramatic “unities”; he dared to be his own master;
and fortunately there were no newspapers in his day
to publish venomous criticisms which might have
daunted or discouraged his efforts.</p>

<p>The earliest newspaper, or <i>News Packet</i>, as it was
called, was issued in 1619, three years after Shakespeare’s
death. Shakespeare’s critics were the public—in
fact, the “gallery.” He “played to the gallery,”
and played “up”—never “down.” Moreover, he was
apparently so indifferent to his own literary reputation
that he made no effort to publish any of his works,
and allowed them to be pirated wholesale. Only in the
case of the two poems dedicated to the Earl of Southampton—“Venus
and Adonis” and “The Rape of Lucrece”—does
he seem to have taken any personal interest
in his own productions.</p>

<p>One may perhaps venture to suggest that probably
he attached no importance to what he knew were
“adaptations” of old plays, and thought nothing of the
rich poesy wherewith he had endowed them. The
most of his work was this of industrious “adaptation”;
so that he might have modestly considered it to be
scarcely his own and that the magnificent speeches he
put in the mouths of his stage puppets were only a
part of what is called “business.” The superb indifference
he thus displayed to his own place in the estimation
of others was a striking proof of his sub-conscious
power. That his contemporaries mentioned him but
little would not have troubled a mind like Shakespeare’s
and Robert Green’s jealous attack upon him as “an
upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, with his
Tyger’s heart wrapt in a Player’s hide,” would but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>293</span>
have moved him to a compassionate smile at such an
outburst of malice and envy.</p>

<p>The chief lesson we may learn from Shakespeare’s
unapproachable fame is of that greatness which is
“impersonal.” The literary men of our day are all
painfully personal and are seldom satisfied unless they
are elbowing each other out of the way or scrambling
over each other to the front; and some of them are
never happier than when they can fasten themselves,
like barnacles, to the splendid ship of Shakespeare’s
immortal genius, which sails serenely onward over the
seas of the infinite. <em>As</em> barnacles they do no particular
harm; for, cling as they will, the great waves of time
generally sweep them off in the progress of the voyage,
while the great Ship goes on, carrying its messages of
truth, honour, and strong patriotism to all the world!
And it will still sail on, till the English language shall
be no more. For if, in centuries to come, nothing
should be left of England but Shakespeare, his name
would be sufficient to prove that England once had
lived!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_44">SHAKESPEARE’S WAR BIRTHDAY IN 1917<br />

<span class="subhead">NEGLECTED HONOURS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Many</span> of our newspapers devoted columns of matter
to “St. George’s Day”; and the writers of the various
articles on this subject “gushed” in special and particular
fashion over a purely mythical knight, whom
legendary lore supposes to have killed a purely mythical
dragon. But a very general omission was made of a
real and a far greater personage than St. George, whose
day of birth and death coincides with that of the dragon-slayer,
namely, William Shakespeare, “the beautifullest
English soul this England confesses to have made, the
pink and flower of remembered Englishmen, the greatest
thing, it appears, that we have yet done and managed
to produce in this world,” according to right-thinking
Thomas Carlyle. America, too, bears witness to the
same truth through the golden voice of her noble teacher
Emerson, who thus writes: “All the sweets and all the
terrors of human lot lay in his mind as truly, but as
softly, as the landscape lies on the eye.” He was,
and is, our greatest Englishman—our finest patriot—and,
when all is said and done, he will be our chief
claim to remembrance in history. Very strange has
it seemed to thousands of us, especially Americans,
that during the present crisis and stress of war the
Press of Great Britain should have apparently forgotten
to mention the name of perhaps the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>295</span>
Maker of England on his natal day. Some one tells
us, “It has never occurred before.” Then why has it
occurred now?</p>

<p>Had Shakespeare been alive to-day we can easily
imagine his attitude in regard to the war. Very English
of English, he would have tolerated no half measures.
He, like Sir Francis Drake, would have had short shrift
for any foe that sought to “raid” the shores of his
beloved Britain! Not for him would have been the
message of the Vice-Admiral at Dover: “We were
<em>fortunate</em> in being able to save the lives of ten German
officers and ninety-five men from the vessels which were
sunk!” He would have exclaimed: “Out upon such
‘fortune’!” And he might have judged it as somewhat
of a <em>mis</em>fortune that a British Vice-Admiral lived who
could write it down as “fortunate” to rescue any members
of the same savage Hun tribe that sank the <i>Lusitania</i>
and scruples not to sink hospital ships! Another
word might have been found for the occasion; and
Shakespeare would have been the man to find it. To
Shakespeare’s mind, a friend was a friend—a foe was
a foe. Treachery was his chief abhorrence. When he
lived in Stratford-on-Avon for the last remaining years
of his career we know by various records that he was
subjected to many petty annoyances at the hands of
his own townsfolk, so that almost up to his death he
was involved in litigation, defending himself from libel
and his daughter from scandal. The Corporation were
ready enough to borrow money of him—yes! that goes
without saying. But for sympathy, comprehension,
and friendship he had to seek outside his native town
altogether. It would seem he has to do that still; and
not only has he to go outside his native town, but outside<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>296</span>
his native land. In America his works are much better
known, loved, and honoured than in Great Britain; in
France, where it is difficult to understand him owing
to the insuperable obstacles of his language for Frenchmen,
there is a “société” founded by an erudite Israelite,
with a British committee who are entirely unknown as
<em>real</em> students of Shakespeare, but who have “names” distinguished
in other walks of life. In Russia the bard
is viewed as a sort of demi-god, for his verse translates
into Russian superbly; and in the Germany of the past
Lessing’s translation of the plays made him the father
of German literature, as represented by Goethe, Schiller,
and others who distinguished themselves before the black
night of Hohenzollern decadence. But if we take our
own islands—in Scotland he is hardly understood; in
Ireland, seldom read or acted; in Wales, almost a sealed
book; while in England itself—well, as Martin Harvey
has recently said, a quarter of one day’s war expenses
would establish a National Theatre, where the great
plays could be produced in a fitting manner as part of
the national education.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>In Stratford-on-Avon this year’s anniversary of the
poet’s birth and death has passed almost unmarked.
No actor has urged his willing service to his Master in
the theatre by the Avon, though this, for many reasons,
is not to be wondered at. True, the bells of the church
rang—true, the flags of nations were unfurled, and
there was a dolefully shabby “flower” procession; but
in the Memorial Theatre there was only a lecture, <em>not</em>
on Shakespeare, but on a movement inaugurated by the
lecturer himself. Then there were all the usual “pats
on the back” of every person to the other concerned, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>297</span>
trifle of music, and there an end. Shakespeare himself
was nowhere, though—yes!—perhaps out in the
moist woods, where the primroses are beginning to push
through the mould and the call of the cuckoo is faintly
heard, one might have met his tranquil Spirit moving
apart from all “alarums and excursions,” and have
heard his voice in words which he could well address just
now to England.</p>

<span class="subhead">(<i>Published in the “Pall-Mall Gazette”</i>)</span></span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">We</span> are all called upon to make sacrifices, both public
and personal. No one can assert that we do not make
them willingly, and for the most part uncomplainingly.
But our Dictators appear blind to the fact that in many
cases their orders and “restrictions” are ruining British
trades, while affording the greatest possible relief and
satisfaction to the Boches. The well-fed Huns heard
with malicious glee the admission of Mr. Bonar Law
that we were at one time short of fighting men by a
hundred thousand—an undiplomatic avowal which for
sheer bad tact ranks alongside of Lord Devonport’s
“grave” warnings of “food shortage,” and Captain
Bathurst’s advertised appetite for “pickled herrings.”
If “shortage” of any kind exists, why “give it away”
to the enemy? It is of a nature to be dealt with “in
secret Session,” not in the open House, where prominent
members themselves admit that whatever is said is
at once taken to Germany. Is it surprising, then, that
with the crazy exaggerations and falsehoods of the German
Press, our foes assert that “England is starving!”
and that “there are not enough men left to us to fight
with!” How much wiser and more dignified it would
be to let them clearly understand that, honestly, we are
not suffering at all from any real food hardships, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>299</span>
that we shall have more than a hundred thousand extra
men ready to fight them should occasion arise. Mr.
Bonar Law may be a Scottish “man of iron,” but he is
also very guileless if he does not realise the derision and
delight of the Boche over the statements he made in
the House—statements repeated throughout Germany,
just as Mr. Lloyd George’s unfortunate phrase, “the
horrible danger of the submarine,” was caught up by
Bethmann-Hollweg, and repeated with devilish laughter
at every street corner in Berlin. When we are at grips
with a foe it is not advisable to show him the loose
joints in our armour. To us British there should be
never a thought or a word of “horrible danger,” especially
as we know we can grow our own necessary food
if we make up our minds to do it; nor should we ever
publicly admit any “shortage” of any kind, whether in
men or supplies. To admit weakness is to court attack.</p>

<p>Now we are told “not to travel”; not to take the much
longed-for Easter rest, with Easter hope of the slowly
coming spring, and there is no doubt that those of us
who have comfortable homes are willing enough to stay
in them. But for the brave, patient men and women
who have given up their homes to toil day and night at
munition work, and who naturally crave for a breath
of country or sea air, whose bodies and souls are weary,
and who need, if only a few hours, change of scene
and movement for their very health’s sake, the restrictions
of train and motor service are surely rather an
exercise of tyranny? Not only does the ban affect the
travelling public (we presume the Cabinet Ministers
will not deny themselves their Easter recess?), but it
spells ruin to thousands of hard-working folk who depend
for their living at this season on letting lodgings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>300</span>
in the country or at the seaside; to say nothing of the
disaster undeservedly inflicted on all our lovely watering-places
and rural resorts, which exist, in a great
measure, on the influx of visitors, whose patronage keeps
them going. Surely it may be asked, Why destroy the
prosperity of our own people? Why lay a paralysing
hand on our own trades and industries? Is it to give
the Boche a better chance when the war is over? Before
the outbreak of the Hohenzollern madness, hotels and
lodging-houses in all our pleasure resorts were numerous
and prosperous, and the greater part of them were
carried on by—Germans! One could not go anywhere
without meeting German managers and German waiters.
Now, when there might be the faint ghost of a
chance for the British hotel-keeper, the British caterer,
the British tradesman, the public are warned off with
“Don’t travel!” What joy for the Germans! Our
Dictators simply “fall” into their hands like drugged
moths into a net, and the way they go to work suggests
an attempt to “Prussianise” England, and make ample
preparation for a German “boom” after the war, when
our own people, half ruined by “restrictions,” have not
even the time to recoup their losses or start afresh on
any new line of possible prosperity. If the enormous
expenditure of the war is to be met by the people, every
chance must be given them to earn the money wherewith
to meet it. None of the workers would trouble the railway
service if motor-cars and conveyances were allowed
to carry them out for an Easter breath of Easter air,
but though military “swaggerers” at home are allowed
to dash about everywhere in cars with apparent freedom,
the “restriction” on petrol holds up all the rest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>301</span>
of the public. Yet, as a matter of common hearsay, it
is asserted that “there is no real scarcity of petrol!”</p>

<p>What are we to believe? One thing is pretty certain,
and that is that the British public, though so patient
“a hass,” may kick at last and refuse to take “rations”
of thistles, while the German Hog is fed on carrots and
corn. To quote from a well-reasoned article in a morning
contemporary: “The blind and fatal shears of promiscuous
prohibition cut off the just and the unjust
together. They are, moreover, a most disturbing element
in trade, and are reducing our merchants to despair.”
True! And if the “disturbing element” is not
promptly checked, we may look out for storms!</p>

</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> is time we gave thanks—indeed, it is more than time!
Perhaps, had we seen more clearly into the future we
might have given thanks long before this—thanks for
our kinship with America—for the ties of blood, of
language, of tradition, memory, and association which
have made us, as some say, “cousins,” but as we prefer
to believe, brothers—brothers in heart and soul, as we
are to-day brothers-in-arms. Let it be admitted that we
have not always quite understood each other. Small
rancours, petty jealousies, trifling differences have arisen
casually from time to time between the people of a great
Empire and the people of a great Republic, which seem
now but the merest gossamer cobwebs spun by the ever-working
spiders of rumour and mischief, easily brushed
away at a touch. The trumpet blast of a noble Cause
has brought to our side our youngest comrade, alive with
energy, passion, and enthusiasm, expressing in every
attitude Tennyson’s eloquent <span class="locked">lines:—</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>303</span></p>
<p>And we have taken our comrade by both hands,
and have knelt with him under the great dome of St.
Paul’s, giving our thanks to God for bringing us this,
our brother; and we claim to say with Lincoln that
we do not presume to ask the Almighty to be on our
side, but we do pray that we may be on the side of
the Almighty! If President Wilson’s “Declaration of
War” against Germany means anything, it means that
right and justice, freedom and truth, are all of God;
and therefore to fight for the maintenance of these
things is to fight for God’s own Law and Order. The
one piece of eloquence which stands out in distinctive
greatness amid all that has yet been spoken concerning
our world-contest, is this “Declaration,” which will
go down to posterity as matchless for high principle,
reasonableness, and clearness of diction—an oration
which no statesman of old time, whether Greek or
Roman, has ever surpassed, in what we know of history.
It should have been read aloud in every church, every
school, every theatre, every public assembly, with as
much impressiveness as a Pope’s “Encyclical,” and
more!</p>

<p>Nothing do we need so much in this country as to
“catch on” to some of the enthusiasm and eagerness
which fires our American Ally, as he springs to our
side in the battle under the bright stars of the “Old
Glory.” He is young, ardent, and ready for anything—quick
eyed, alert of brain, he means to “hustle”!
Some of us need to be infected by this splendid youth.
A curious lethargy clings to us at times—a kind of
dumb spell. Is it excess of feeling? Or—is it sheer
egotism? Our French friends marvel at the indifference
we show at the victories just won by Sir Douglas<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>304</span>
Haig. They thought to see all London beflagged in the
great soldier’s honour. Very certainly they had hoped
the “Stars and Stripes” might be flown from every
public building on the day of the President’s Declaration—but
no!—not even in Stratford-on-Avon, that
shrine of America’s devoted Shakespeare-Worship, was
any sign given of the momentous event. Rather discreditable
to Stratford, remembering that in peace times
Shakespeare’s Town depends very much for its livelihood
on its crowds of American visitors. But what does
Shakespeare himself say?</p>

<p>Let us hope that it is not so much ingratitude as
inability to appreciate the situation.</p>

<div class="tb">* * * * *</div>

<p>No wonder Americans find it sometimes difficult to
know or to understand us. For months they have heard
their President persistently abused, they have seen him
cruelly caricatured and jeered at in the lower sections
of the British Press, and they have had to possess their
souls in patience till their day of triumph came. It
has come—the bitter tongues are now all honey—and
their generosity in forgiving and forgetting wrongs and
coming to us in perfect amity, glittering in the panoply
of battle, and placing almost inexhaustible supplies at
our service, is a truly great and wonderful thing. We
have done ourselves honour by the thanksgiving in St.
Paul’s; and some of us who knelt in the dim shadows
of that vast shrine and heard the thunderous chords of
the American National Hymn surging in our ears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>305</span>
prayed that the two great English-speaking peoples, now

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_47">THE WOMEN’S VOTE<br />

<span class="subhead">NATURE VERSUS POLITICS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Those</span> far-sighted and indulgent men who supported
“Votes for Women” should surely be enjoying to the
full the result of their pliability and humour! In the
“Coupon Election” they expected six million feminine
votes—for Coalition, of course. If we conjugate Ministerial
messages as one verb, they could all have been
rendered thus: “<em>I</em> expect, <em>you</em> expect, <em>he</em> expects”
women to do their duty. But one point seems rather
overlooked, and that is, the precise idea women have
of duty. When I say “women” I mean women in the
grand majority—not a few hundreds or even a few
thousand agitators. And I dare to suggest that these
“women in the grand majority,” do not care about
their “votes” in the least—and that all the roaring of
a megaphone press will never make them care. Nature
is, and always will be, too strong for them, and Nature
has not endowed them, except in a few rare cases, with
a taste for politics. But Nature has given them far
greater qualities, and has organised them in a special
way—a way most beautiful, wonderful, and nobly privileged;
and the greatest social reformer that ever risked
the oft-tried sorry business of “re-constructing” civilisation,
can never alter the work for which Nature is alone
responsible. I do not believe that Women, speaking in
the plural of nationalities, ever wanted the vote at all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>307</span>—but
that seeing (and hearing) the wild clamour of some
of their sisters, who shrieked and smashed themselves
into notoriety, they were attracted by the fun of it, the
noise of it, the curious, rowdy, non-feminine spirit of it,
and followed the whooping and the yells with the fascinated
amusement of children running after the “One
Man Band” who beats a drum with his elbows and
clashes cymbals with his feet. Mr. Lloyd George is a
wise thinker in his generation, but his sagacity will be
at fault if it should be proved (Heaven forbid!) that
after all—yes, after all the screaming and smashing of
windows, and all the efforts made on their behalf—the
women as a whole prove apathetic and indifferent to this
wonderful privilege they have fought for and won!</p>

<p>There is a French story of a certain spoilt little lady
whose husband adored her, from the glimmer of her
topmost blonde curl to the point of her broidered shoe,
and who expressed to him her ardent wish for a diamond
chain she had seen in an expensive jeweller’s window.
Her husband, though rich and generous, apparently
paid no attention to her oft-repeated request, till one
day he suddenly presented her with the coveted ornament
as a “surprise packet” and token of his affection.
But she pushed the gift aside and gave way to bitter
tears. “Why, oh, why did you bring me such a thing?”
she sobbed. “I shall never wear it! Oh, <em>why</em> didn’t
you buy me that dear weeny-teeny dog I saw yesterday!
The <em>weeny</em> pet! I would have loved it so! I would
have talked to it about <em>you</em>!—it would have been <em>such</em> a
companion! Oh, I <em>did</em> want that <em>weeny</em> darling!”</p>

<p>There is a moral in this story (despite the contempt
it must evoke among future female M.P.s), and “the
pint,” as Captain Cuttle or his friend Jack Bunsby re<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>308</span>marked,
“lies in the application on it.” Whether Mr.
Lloyd George and the supporters of the Women’s Franchise
will perceive it is problematical—but whether
they do or do not, there is a curious nature-fact about
Woman which is frequently missed or overlooked by
Man. It is this: <em>That when she is given what she wants,
she doesn’t want it!</em> That is to say—the gaining of her
objective concludes her active interest in it; the thing
is possessed, and promptly loses its value. With the
swiftness and ease of a butterfly she deserts the blossom
from which she has stripped the pollen!</p>

<p>“Equality of the sexes” is one of the advanced feminine
war-cries, when every one with a grain of common
sense knows there is and can be no such equality.
Nature’s law forbids. Nature insists on contrasts; the
small and the great, the weak and the strong, the light
and the dark. And women know well enough that their
“calling and election” are superior to those of men—they
are the makers of the race and the ordainers of the
future, but their strength is not on the hustings or in
the polling-booth—it is in the silence and sweetness of
“Home.” The home is the acorn from which springs
the oak of a nation. Women’s own instincts teach them
that their power is too sacred a thing for common discussion;
and when, in their despite, such discussion is
let loose in the press by vulgarly interested sexualists
and sensualists, their contempt is not concealed. They
feel, strongly enough too, when questioned in the right
spirit, that it is not needful for them to mix with the
undignified scrambling of political methods; and any
“apathy” as to the use of the vote, is simply that they
have, or think they have, something better to do. Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>309</span>
indeed! They really and truly think that their home
affairs, their children, their daily duties, even their
clothes, are more in their line than “Coalition”! They
are for unity of purpose most assuredly—all of one
mind as to the punishment of surely the most miserable
man on earth, the ex-Kaiser—equally of one mind concerning
the barring out of the Huns from further interference
of their own folks’ businesses—but they think,
and rightly too, that so far as putting the nation’s house
in order goes, the men should be trusted to do it. There
was something very funny in Mr. Lloyd George’s opening
words to a women’s meeting at Queen’s Hall—“I
feel very shy and solitary!” Did he? Surely this was
a bit of “camouflage”? But putting all blandishment
aside, it is just a toss-up as to whether women’s votes
will be quite as influential as prophesied. One of the
surprises of the Coupon Election was Mr. Lloyd
George’s “sweep-aside” of a chivalrous male candidate
in favour of Miss Pankhurst, who, so it is understood,
threatened the direst things against him in past “militant”
days! Generosity and magnanimity on the part
of a Prime Minister to a Suffragette, a male to a female,
could no farther go!—but one wonders if the modern
“Glendower” realised the effect his action had on many
thousands of non-Pankhurst women? For sheer humiliation
it came second only to the surrender of the German
Fleet! Whether it served as good a purpose was
answered by the result. “Drive Nature out of the door,
she comes flying back through the window,” and one
of the most curious, purely natural traits in woman’s
complex character, is that she loves to have her own
way up to a certain point, but when that point is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>310</span>
gained she has had enough, and turns to man with a
“Here! <em>You</em> take it!” And no woman has yet been
returned to Parliament, for which we may all, if we
have any common sense, thank God, and hope for the
best that she never will be!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_48">A “HAPPY THOUGHTS” DAY<br />

<span class="subhead">(<i>Written specially for the Grantham Red Cross Outings Fund</i>)</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Here</span> is an idea for every one—young and old, rich
and poor! Let us institute a “Happy Thoughts” Day!—one
day out of the seven on which we resolve to
think only “Happy” thoughts! Thoughts of kindness,
tenderness, hope, and unselfishness—thoughts which,
even while we think them, take fairy wings and fly from
ourselves to our neighbours and propagate other happy
thoughts, creating cheerfulness and hope wherever they
go. It is not easy, perhaps, to think “happy” thoughts
in dark days, but no good task can be accomplished
without difficulty. A much more simple and convenient
thing it is to grumble!—to lay our own faults on the
shoulders of others,—to believe that our own troubles
are the worst in the world,—to sneer at other folks’ manners,
looks, clothes, and opinions, and to throw out mocking
jests and cruel laughter at those whom we affect
to despise yet secretly envy;—but on our “Happy
Thoughts” day we can have none of these ugly and
ordinary vulgarities,—we must make a bid for something
higher and more exquisite in grace and refinement.
We must think “happily” of others while we
hope they will also think “happily” of us. We will
make up our minds to find our friends beautiful, charming,
and lovable; we will cheerfully admire them and
their appearance and conversation,—we will agree<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>312</span>
that it is a special blessing conferred on us that we
have any friends at all,—and we will confess that
our lot in life is much better than we have any right
to expect. And we will send our “happy thoughts”
across the seas to suffering nations, conjoined with our
hopeful prayers—prayers that they may be sustained
and comforted, and by God’s mercy be victorious. And
above all, we will let our “Happy Thoughts Day” reflect
its cheeriness in ourselves,—in our looks and bearing,
our talk and expression, so that we may be the carriers
of mental sunshine everywhere, even during the passing
of the darkest thundercloud. One day out of the seven,
dear friends!—take it and consecrate it to “Happy
Thoughts,” happy thoughts of earth, of heaven, of God
and man,—and you will find it a day on which you
unconsciously grow stronger, braver, pleasanter to look
at, more valuable to know,—for happiness is a powerful
magnet, and never fails to draw others to its vital line.
May a “Happy Thoughts Day” be the true holiday of
every loving and faithful soul!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_49">WHY DID I——?</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">I should</span> not presume to write this answer to numerous
correspondents, had it not been for the precedent given
by Mr. Garvin, the erudite editor of the <i>Observer</i>, who
recently allotted several columns of his own paper to
the praise of his own book. Wherefore, gladly accepting
this “lead” from one who knows so much more about
literary “management” than I do, I take the opportunity
of replying to several letters demanding “Why”
I wrote my last published novel, <i>The Young Diana</i>.
Why? Well, because (like Mr. Garvin on himself) I
think it a good idea! Moreover, I wanted to be one
of the first in the field to suggest a discovery which is
approaching us in the near future; which is, so to
speak, “glimmering” ahead of our scientists like a
brilliant streak of sunrise in a summer sky. Following
the example of Mr. Garvin, who urgently recommends
the public to read <em>his</em> book, I, with equal urgency
recommend the public to read <em>mine</em>. I should not have
dared to do so unless Mr. Garvin had shown me the
way, and he is such a noted authority in journalism that
I feel I cannot do wrong in copying him as much as
possible. Therefore, dear public!—good readers all!—I
assure you that <i>The Young Diana</i> is a remarkable
book. It is, really! Mr. Garvin says his is a remarkable
book, and I feel that mine is equally remarkable. It
is full of new ideas, happily expressed. Garvinly
speaking, it is a compendium of hope for mankind, or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>314</span>
rather womankind, because it shows how possibly the
youth and beauty of the fairer sex may be retained
indefinitely, to say nothing of the prolongation of life.
Nobody wants to grow old, not even Garvin; as a
matter of fact nobody <em>does</em> grow old nowadays: witness
our beautiful Queen Alexandra and the ever lithe and
lissom “Tiger” Clemenceau. To read <i>The Young
Diana</i>, you need a little intelligence, of course. So you
do when you read <i>The Economic Foundations of Peace</i>
by Garvin. His book costs 12s. net—mine is only
6s. 9d. His treats of “the policy upon which the safety,
the prosperity, the very physical survival of humanity
depend.” Mine treats likewise of all these things,
vested in fair Woman, upon whom the physical existence
as well as “survival” of man depends. His, according
to his friends on the press, is “a great idea brilliantly
presented.” So is mine. It is, to quote another friend’s
criticism, “a practical and passionate effort to save the
world alive.” Oh, friends! this is exactly what <em>my</em>
book is!—only it is a practical and passionate effort to
save <em>Woman</em> alive!—beautiful and exquisite Woman!—the
Mother of all Man! It is “filled with cogent argument
and luminous illustration”—I copy Garvin critiques
because I shouldn’t know how to lay on the
butter so felicitously as the friends of “this remarkable
book by a great journalist”—but I have occasionally
been called “a great novelist,” by semi-crazed folk, of
course, and I feel justified (after Garvin) in calling
attention to my “remarkable book.” Garvinly speaking,
“it is a timely, wise and nobly-inspired book”—you see
I haven’t a newspaper of my own in which to blow my
own small trumpet, so I catch the silvery echo of
Garvin’s glorious and mellow horn and trust to my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>315</span>
readers to catch the sound and the meaning thereof!
So read <i>The Young Diana</i>!—if she had only been at
the Peace Conference all would have been well! <i>Diana</i>
is a book “which will leave the reader with a better
hope of the future”—(vide <i>Observer</i>)—yes, indeed, it
will! Women will radiate under its influence; beauty
will have no fear of perishing; life will be “a joy for
ever,” and all this for six shillings and ninepence!
Think of it! Had I a journal of my own I would have
out-Garvined Garvin in self-adulation, but this is only
a reply to my numerous correspondents who ask, “Why
did you write <i>The Young Diana</i>?” and my answer is
because, like Garvin, I seek to re-invigorate, reform,
and re-establish the world! Amen!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="hdr_50">IN THE HUSH OF THE DAWN<br />

<span class="subhead">A THOUGHT</span>
</h2>
</div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Silence</span> now where so lately the guns thundered their
terrific message,—silence, beautiful and wonderful,
where just a while ago the bursting bombs and shrieking
shells tore the air on their errands of doom. Silence!—peace!—the
hush of the dawn before the rising of the
sun! Nothing in nature is perhaps more impressive
than this dumb spell which precedes approaching morning,—when
every blade of grass, every leaf on every tree
seems to wait attentively for the day. And nothing in
the condition of human affairs is more awe-inspiring to
the thinker and idealist than the dramatic pause of a
break between battles,—an armistice, which may or may
not lead to lasting peace. We feel, as it were, the slow
passing of mist and cloud across the sky—we watch pale
glimmerings of gold and rose in the lightening east—we
think we see the morning glory on the distant hills! For
those who view the pageant of history with living interest,
and notably for us who are permitted to witness
the most marvellous scene ever enacted in it, this is
not a time for wild whirling to and fro in a round of
social excitement and foolish chattering,—it is far more
a time for prayer. Even as the Eastern worshipper
prostrates himself on the earth and waits for the rising
of the sun, so should we both spiritually and intellectually
prostrate ourselves in humility before the shining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>317</span>
hope of the wonderful Light which promises to illumine
the world’s darkness,—the light of peace and unity
which shall make war impossible. For, though we may
dance and sing and shout “Victory!” at the top of our
voices, that Light does not as yet shine,—that sun has
not yet risen! Men are not yet of one straight mind.
A great majority “love darkness rather than light because
their deeds are evil.” Could we call our nation
one of absolute unity in purpose, resolved to put aside
personal prejudices and interests for the good of the
whole State, we should be certain of a real “sunrise”—we
should almost touch the millennium! But though we
deem the cruellest war of all time ended, and though the
Supreme Power has given to our arms a victory so
sudden and miraculous that we are left, as it were,
breathless and staring, half in doubt as to whether our
fortune be truly real, we are not able, apparently, to
stand still in our mercifully <em>un</em>-invaded country and
look each other in the face without quarrelling. Much
talk there is of reform and betterment, but if each man
who advocates these things begins the work by arguing
foolish details with his political rival, there is little hope
of any useful action ensuing. Should we not call a
“hush” on these agitating folk?—a request for pause
before they cast up dust into the clear spaces of the
dawn? Let us have a pure and open sky! Let us watch
the colours of hope and gladness deepen softly and surely
on the long-darkened horizon—and let no murky miasma
of discontent and disloyalty mar the happiness of
the rising sun! A nobler People,—a better, grander,
stronger Empire!—this is what our king and all our
wisest men appeal for in this “hush of the dawn.”
Surely it is the highest privilege in the world to know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>318</span>
that we can all help in this work of Peace as we have
helped in War,—we were all at one in making munitions
for death;—let us all be similarly at one in making
munitions for life. We are given our freedom by the
sacrifice of thousands of brave men,—we shall not honour
their memories now by ceaseless disputations as to
our own material advantages. We desire surely that
their dauntless and noble spirits shall know that our
gratitude for their heroism inspires us to build up a
nobler civilisation than we have ever had before,—and
to this end we pray God who hath given us the victory,—so
far!—in the hush of the dawn!</p>

  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
